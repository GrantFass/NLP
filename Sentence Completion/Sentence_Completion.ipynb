    "# Sentence Completion\n",
    "This notebook is used for a final project as a part of the CS 4980 Natural Language Processing course at the Milwaukee School of Engineering during the spring term of 2023. This notebook was created by [Grant Fass](grantfass@gmail.com) and [Nicholas Kaja](kajan@msoe.edu). The following notebook will explore the problem of natural language sentence completion. This notebook can also be reached directly through the following GitHub repository: [https://github.com/GrantFass/NLP/tree/main/Sentence%20Completion](https://github.com/GrantFass/NLP/tree/main/Sentence%20Completion)\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural language sentence completion involves determining what word best fits in a blank present in a sentence. This type of question is typically found on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). It is useful because it can measure the performance of a language model (LM) on questions that educational experts deem important. LMs that perform well on this type of problem will likely perform better on broader tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary method for forming a sentence completion model is to compute the probability of each possible sentence tehn choose the most probable option. This probability computation can be done using n-grams, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and Syntactic Dependency Trees. Some research has also been done into combining these with methods of preserving long-range dependencies in the sentences. Of these options, N-grams is one of the easiest starting points due to its ease of implementation and understanding. N-grams also allow for sufficient variations over the base model such as different N-gram algorithms, different values of N, and different methods of tokenization.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be constructing our models from a dataset of Khan Academy lecture transcripts. This dataset was scraped using BeautifulSoup during January of 2023 by Nicholas Kaja as a part of a senior design project. The performance of our model will be evaluated on a [SAT Question Dataset](https://github.com/ctr4si/sentence-completion/tree/master/data/completion). After evaluation, we plan to take our best performing model and apply it to sentence generation. This will allow us to get a better feel for how well it performs. Once our model is working, we also plan to implement some additional features such as Named Entity Recognition (NER). If there is enough time we also plan to investigate using the [OpenAI tokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) instead of the [NLTK Word Tokenizer](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html) or the [SpaCy Tokenizer](https://spacy.io/api/tokenizer). The OpenAI tokenizer has a [python package found on github](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information please see the Data Collection And Processing document as well as the Project Background document. Both of these documents can be found in the repository under the Sentence Completion directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Demo:\n",
    "Note that this file is mainly used for training and testing the model we build. It also includes the explanations of processes. To view an interactive demo please visit the website located at [grantfass.org](http://grantfass.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pip Installations\n",
    "The below magic command should install all of the required python packages to run this project. If it does not run successfully please try to run the command through an admin shell instead."

    "## Cleaning\n",
    "This section is dedicated to cleaning up some of our vocabulary dataset before it is used to create the vocabulary. We have decided, for simplicity, to remove the first sentence of every transcript in the dataset. This will allow us to easily remove all of the tagging information such as \"[Instructor]\" and \"- Speaker 1:\". Most of the first sentences are greetings and introductions. As such they are not necessarily as important to answering the SAT question dataset. We have also elected to expand contractions, remove html tags, remove quotes, and replace accented characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same general cleaning method is run over our testing data as well. The first sentence removal is not performed on the testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Note] Before this section, as a part of the cleaning, we will want to perform SpaCy NER. Use SpaCy NER to identify the multi-word-expressions then use the [nltk.tokenize.mwe module](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.mwe.html) to combine the tokens - Grant."

The baseline prediction worked by taking the log in base 10 of (the count of the ngram divided by the count of the one smaller ngram). The code for this is shown below. All scores reported in this section are f1-scores. The two datasets that were evaluated were the SAT question dataset (SAT) and the SC-Ques dataset (ESL). The basline performance was 0.155 for SAT and 0.209 for ESL. Out of the possible models it appears that the best prediction accuracy was attained when using lm.score with the Maximum Likelihood Estimator. The most optimal size for n is likely 3 or 4. Quadgrams have a slightly better score, but take longer to train. For testing purposes bigrams may be the best option.\n",

    "## Evaluation of Results\n",
    "Our model does not perform that well currently. We hypothesize that this is due to both the complexity of the words in the SAT question dataset as well as the size of our input dataset. Our input dataset is only comprised of around 600,000 sentences. Additionally, our input dataset comes from spoken lecture transcripts. While these transcripts should be on fairly complex topics, they still contain mostly spoken language. The SAT question dataset prompts are more complex than the language spoken in our input dataset. This leads to a mismatch between our corpus and training data where most of our n-grams either have low counts or do not exist in our corpus. This could be remedied by expanding the size of our input dataset and thusly our corpus. The research paper that our test dataset came from compiled their corpus on over 1.1 billion words in newspaper articles. Even with this large increase in corpus size they still only achieved a prediction accuracy of just over 50% on the testing dataset. This implies that the test dataset is fairly difficult to get high accuracy scores on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we did not perform cross validation on our system. The primary reason for this is due to cross validation not making sense in our case. We have created a corpus and are trying to compute the accuracy of our corpus using a test set. As we are not directly training a model, it does not make sense to perform cross validation only over our test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additionl Dataset Note\n",
    "[Note] One additional area of improvement that we should also test is improving the size of our test set. I found another dataset that will work for this from the paper [SC-Ques: A Sentence Completion Question Dataset for English as a Second Language Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12036). They provided a [link to their code and their data](https://github.com/ai4ed/SC-Ques) for research purposes. This, in turn, gave a link to a [dropbox containing their data](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lzznin2hxt6rmft/SC-Ques.tar.gz?dl=0). The data that we would be looking to use to expand our training set would be found in test.jsons and train.jsons. These two files have been preprocessed in the SC-Ques-Preprocessing.ipynb notebook and saved to the individual processed_data_idx.csv files. They were stored as multiple files due to space limitations with GitHub repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The below section is used to read in and join each of the processed_data_idx.csv files. There should be no need to run the SC-Ques-Preprocessing.ipynb script and is only included for posterity."

    "## Sentence Generation\n",
    "The below section takes a look at both sentence generation, as well as the optimization of some existing processes. Much of the work in this section is originally based on [a stack overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54979617) and [the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) documentation from NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.lm.html). The work in this section could be performed as one command if we were to use the padded_everygram_pipeline method. Unfortunatly, this method presents certain downsides when the n-gram size is larger than 2 (bigrams). This is because the sentences will be padded with more than one start of sentence or end of sentence tag. This leads to the model predicting the end of sentence tag following another end of sentence tag, thus causing an infinite loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we will perform these steps in parts. The first part would be to get a flattened list of tokens comprised of each padded sentence in our corpus. This can be done using the flatten and pad_both_ends commands. As mentioned earlier, even if the n-gram size is larger than two, a value of 2 should be passed in to pad_both_ends. Following this, we can calculate our n-grams using everygrams, or ngrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "As per [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/60661188) the padded_everygram_pipeline creates the following iterators:\n",
    "- sentences padded and turned into sequences of `nltk.util.everygrams`\n",
    "- sentences padded as above and chained together for a flat stream of words\n",
    "\n",
    "This information should help with passing arguments to the fit method of the MLE"
