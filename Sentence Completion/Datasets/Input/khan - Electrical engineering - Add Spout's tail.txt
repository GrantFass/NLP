So in this video, we're
going to use a paper clip to add a little tail
to Spout, to help to reduce some of his
friction as he's moving around on the ground. This may help improve the
performance of the bot, so let's see. We're going to just
take a paper clip and bend it out and then
cut it with our needle nose there, with the cutting section. And we're just going to try and
get that tail the stick down, not quite as far as the motors,
but further than the back of the battery holder right now. And you can sort of make
yours whatever shape you like, but this basically
will allow the bot to have a lot less
drag on the ground. So it works pretty
well when it's running over a smooth surface. So again, once
you've got it bent and it fits pretty well
between the two switches, you can obviously
adjust it and bend it to where it's just the right
height and lines up perfectly. And then once you've
got that figured out, you can take your hot glue
gun and hot glue it in place. Now we'll also use the hot
glue when I glue this in place to hold that last wire, the
yellow wire, in place too, because some of the hot glue
will spill over onto it there. And again. There we go. Where's the hot glue gun? There it is, all right. So again, you want to make sure
there's a fair amount of glue on it, and you've
got to let it sit until the glue
has turned opaque. Alright, now that the
glues dry, let's try it out and see if it's any better. That's a little better. A little bit more responsive. So we can see that
Spout is starting to back up a little
bit better on his own. He still does need
a little bit of help sometimes, to get the switches
to trigger so he'll back up. Next video, we're going to see
if we can optimize Spout even more, so he's more
energetic and reactive, and he backs up better when
he bumps into new obstacles.
