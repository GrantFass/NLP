Simplify the expression 28b
to the sixth divided by 7b. Well this is the same
thing as 28/7 times b to the sixth over b. And I did it this
way so that we have b to the sixth over b
to some other power. And this is over b, which is the
same thing as b to the first. So we could simplify this
using exponent properties. And 28/7 we can just
clearly simplify because 28 is divisible by 7. 28 divided by 7 is just 4. So that is just 4. And then b to the
sixth divided by b to the one, that's just going
to be b to the sixth minus 1 power. So times b to the sixth
minus 1 or b to the fifth. So our answer is
4b to the fifth.
