(lamp and ball hopping) (light clicks) - We can express so much
emotion through our bodies, but I really love using rigging
to make expressive faces. It is fascinating to learn about how our faces display emotions or ideas. There's so much detail
in every expression. In our next exercise, we're
gonna rig a snowman face and we need some new Deformers to do that. First, let's add a directional scale. A directional scale allows us to scale in just one direction. If you scale a hat using ScaleY, you'll get a taller hat
that looks like a top hat. If you scale the face with ScaleX, you will get a wider face. We also need shear Deformers. Shear Deformers are similar
to directional scales, in the sense that they work
in a specific direction. We also have our set of
rotates and translates and scales that we already used. Just as before, you
should work rough to fine, with rotating the head to begin with and then translating and rotating the hat. Remember, the order of
your Deformers matters, so test your controls as you work. When you finish rigging the head, move on to the next lesson, where you'll learn to write
code to make your own character.
