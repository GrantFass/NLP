Write a polynomial to express
the total value of p $20 bills, q $10 bills,
and r $5 bills. So what's the value
of p $20 bills? Well if I have p $20 bills,
the value of each of those dollar bills is going
to be $20. So the value all p of them
is going to be 20p. If I have one $20
bill, it's $20. If I have three $20 bills, if p
is 3, it's going to be $60. Actually, let me do that
in the same color as I underlined it. I underlined it in yellow. So let me do the p $20 bills. So 20p is the p $20 bills. Then you have your
q $10 bills. So what's the value of those? Well it's going to be 10q. If I have one $10 bill,
it's worth $10. If I have ten $10 bills, if q
is 10, this is going to be worth 10 times 10. $100. And then finally you have your r
$5 bills, which are going to be worth 5r dollars. One $5 bill, worth $5. Two $5 bills, worth $10. And we're done. We've expressed it
as a polynomial. Polynomial just means that we
have multiple terms here and this is three terms. We could
even call it a trinomial. Polynomial is a more general
term for more than one term.
