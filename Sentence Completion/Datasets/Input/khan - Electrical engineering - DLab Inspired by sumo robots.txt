SPEAKER 1: So we're going
to do one more round. SPEAKER 2: Innovation is
coming up with new ideas. And it's just like making
your own unique ideas and building on those. If we copy other people's
ideas, our competitors will know about it and
they can easily stop us. So we have to come
up with our own ideas to get an edge over them. First we were
coming up with ideas on what we were going to do. That's the first
step, brainstorming. And then the second
part was just getting all your
ideas down and picking a few that actually work. SPEAKER 3: We brainstormed
a lot of ideas to just making a shooter
which would shoot. And then we just tried to
modify to make the shooter stand up well and kind of fit it
into place like a puzzle. SPEAKER 2: So here we
have double treads, and it's really hard to push. And right here we
have a light sensor, so it doesn't go out of the
arena and we won't lose. This is another motor that we
added later on in our building, and it shoots these balls. We're going to have a
competition on Friday to see who can build
their own NXT robots. And we fight each
other in an arena. SPEAKER 3: So the main
objective of the competition is to make your SumoBot the
last one standing in the arena. SPEAKER 2: Oh,
we're going to win because we have a shooter
that nobody else has, and we have shield in
the front and the back. And I could barely
push our robot away, so I don't know how their
robots are going to. SPEAKER 3: Yeah, they don't
know what's coming at them. SPEAKER 1: Sumo! [LAUGHTER] SPEAKER 1: OK.
