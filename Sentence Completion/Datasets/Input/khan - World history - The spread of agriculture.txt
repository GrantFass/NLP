- [David] Hey, Rosie. - [Rosie] Hey, David. - [David] So as you know,
I am a bit of a foodie. And you know what foodies
love more than anything? - [Rosie] Food? - [David] Well, yeah, but, road trips. - [Rosie] (laughing) Cool, yes. - [David] So what I would like to do is go on a road trip and follow
the origins of agriculture. Starting at about 11,000
years ago to bring us into the era of history. So we're going from this
neolithic pre-writing time that brings us all the way
up to the first cities. - [Rosie] Great. - [David] So, Rosie. Where do we begin? - [Rosie] Okay, we begin
in modern-day Iraq, Syria, and Turkey. - [David] Okay, so kind of
this "Fertile Crescent" area, a little bit of Asia Minor. This is a very gross
over-generalization of the region we're talking about,
'cause I'm looking at this from a globe perspective
with no country borders. Which is actually ideal,
because there were no nation-states, right, there's just kind of damp places where
barley grows at this point. - [Rosie] And that's exactly
what was growing there. People were farming when
people started farming, wheat and barley. And they were also domesticating animals. Sheep, goats, cows, and pigs. The neat thing is that
in all of these places that we're gonna look at, agriculture was developing independently. These were some of the first
birthplaces of agriculture in the world, and people
in these locations just invented it on their own. - [David] So it's not like
someone from the Fertile Crescent wandered over to Mexico and
said, "Hey, I discovered this "thing with barley. "You should try it with corn." This is more like independent
groups of human beings all discovered this stuff
independent of one another. - [Rosie] That's right. - [David] Kind of like
the way Newton and Leibniz both discovered the calculus. - [Rosie] Exactly. (laughing) - [David] Just trying to
make some cross-disciplinary connections. - [Rosie] I like it. - [David] Thank you. Okay,
so this is our earliest one, 9000 B.C.E. - [Rosie] 9000 B.C.E.,
that's the first evidence that archaeologists have of agriculture. - [David] Okay. - [Rosie] Then we move to modern-day Sudan near the Sahara Desert, the
southeastern edge of it, 'cause it's a very big desert. - [David] And what was
grown there, pray tell? - [Rosie] Sorghum. - [David] So today in the United States, sorghum is used mostly for animal feed, but also, you can make
a sweet syrup out of it. I imagine the ancient peoples used it as kind of a general purpose staple grain. - [Rosie] Right. They also
domesticated cows and sheep. - [David] So that's, how
long ago was that, Rosie? - [Rosie] That was from 9000-7000 B.C.E. - [David] And that's where the Sudan and the South Sudan is today. - [Rosie] Yes. - [David] Okay. - [Rosie] Then, over on
the western side of Africa in what is today Nigeria,
about a thousand years later, people started cultivating
yams, okra, and black-eyed peas. - [David] So okra, kinda
these long green pods. You may have eaten them before,
they're quite delicious. They kind of have a
delicious mucilaginous goop. - [Rosie] Mmmm. - [David] I know that doesn't
sound delicious, but it is. It's really important for gumbo and all sorts of foundational cuisines. It's also got this lovely little flower. So okay, we've got okra. - [Rosie] Okra, yams, and black-eyed peas. - [David] Now for those of you that live in the American South, you may recognize a lot of these vegetables as being parts of your diet as well. That's something we'll cover several thousand years from now. - [Rosie] Yeah, the time
period on these crops is from about 8000-6000 B.C.E.
is when those got started. - [David] And both of these
are in sub-Saharan Africa, so if we pause it, the desert
is up here and up here. These regions are beneath it. - [Rosie] That's right. - [David] Okay. - [Rosie] Now David, we're gonna head over to East Asia for a little bit. - [David] So this here is Yangtze River. - [Rosie] Yes. - [David] So what do we have? - [Rosie] Well starting
at about 6500 B.C.E., people who lived along the
river started farming rice. There's rice paddies, and rice
needs a lot of water to grow. They also domesticated pigs and buffalo, which is kind of neat, and
they domesticated chicken. So then we go north of the Yangtze River. In the Yellow River area of
China, and about 5500 B.C.E. people there started to
cultivate millet and soybeans. - [David] And Rosie, when
did the Yangtze cultivation of rice, pigs, buffalo... - [Rosie] At about 6500 B.C.E. - [David] Gotcha. Alright, so we've got these millet stalk, and then the big broad
leaves of the soybean plant, little beans hanging down. So that was about 5500. - [Rosie] That's right,
and we're going to move over to Mexico for a
little bit in 4000 B.C.E. - [David] Right here? - [Rosie] Right there. So here we have those maize plants that you were telling us
about in the last video. Later on they started cultivating
all kinds of other plants such as beans, peppers,
squashes, and tomatoes. But in 4000 B.C.E. they
were growing lots of maize. So in about 3000 B.C.E,
over in Southeast Asia. - [David] So this is Thailand,
Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia. - [Rosie] Yes, yes. So in 3000 B.C.E., that area
saw cultivation of taro. - [David] So taro is like
a starchy root vegetable. - [Rosie] Taro, yams,
coconuts, bread fruit, bananas, and citrus fruits. - [David] What's interesting to me is that with the exception of citrus here, all of these things that we're looking at, so rice, millet, wheat, barley,
yams, sorghum, bread fruit, taro, they're all starches. - [Rosie] Yeah, high calorie foods. - [David] And I guess these
are the sorts of things that can sustain a person. - [Rosie] Right. I think when people were
starting agriculture, they had to find what would
be the best bang for the buck, or the most effective types of food since this is uncharted territory. So foods that had a lot of
calories, that were more able to sustain people would
probably be the better choice. - [David] So finishing up our world tour. - [Rosie] Yes, we're coming
back over to the Americas in Peru and the Andes Mountains. Farmers were growing potatoes... - [David] Oh yay. - [Rosie] Which we haven't seen
yet, which is kind of cool. - [David] So potatoes is
foods that is eaten now all over the world. The same as all of these crops. Begins in this one weird
little mountain area. - [Rosie] After 3000 B.C.E. And this is also the one
place in the Americas where we see animals getting domesticated during this time period. In other parts of the
Americas, there weren't animals that were easily domesticated. But here we've got llamas,
alpacas, and even guinea pigs were domesticated. - [David] All of those
animals are still domesticated in that region today,
including guinea pig, which in Quechua is called
cuye, which people still eat. I would be curious to try it actually. - [Rosie] Yeah, me too. - [David] So Rosie, that's
our world tour of agriculture. You can see all over the
world, from 9000 B.C.E. to 3000 B.C.E., human beings
were adapting the local flora to their own needs. And in some cases, domesticating
animals like llamas and pigs and sheep and guinea pigs. - [Rosie] Pretty neat. So David, throughout the
world, as you were saying, all of these independent
locations, there's this growth of agriculture. So how did that affect these
settlements and villages in the way that people
organized their lives? - [David] Well Rosie, that's
a story for another time.
