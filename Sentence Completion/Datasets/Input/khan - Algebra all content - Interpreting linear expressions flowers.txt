Martin likes to
make flower bouquets that each have 3
violets and 4 tulips. If the price of a violet is V
and the price of a tulip is T, match the expressions
to their meanings. So let's see-- the price
of 1 of Martin's bouquets. So one of Martin's bouquets
has 3 violets and 4 tulips. So the 3 violets are
going to cost 3 times the price of the
violet, which is V. So that's the cost of
the violets, 3V. And then the 4 tulips
are going to cost 4 times the price of a tulip. So that's 4T. So it's 3V plus 4T. So it's not this one. Let's see. This one right over
here, this is 4T plus 3V. So this is the price of 4
tulips, 4 times the price of a tulip, plus 3 times
the price of a violet. The price of 3 of
Martin's bouquets, so it's essentially going
to be 3 times this quantity right over here. This is the price of 1 bouquet. We want 3 of them. So it's going to be 3 times
the quantity 4T plus 3V. And let's see. If I were to actually multiply
this out, 3 times 4T is 12T, and then plus 3 times 3V is 9V. So this is the same
thing if I were to distribute the
3-- is 12T plus 9V. Well, that's this
right over here. These two are
equivalent expressions. And let's see. Are any of these other
things equivalent? No, this says 3
times 3T plus 4V. So I'm going to put this
in the not used bucket. And then I have--
let's see-- 3V plus 2T. I'm going to put it in
the not used bucket. And let's see. This has 2V plus 4T plus V.
So if I were to simplify this, if I were to combine the V
terms-- if I have two V's and I add another V, that's
three V's plus 4T. So this is actually the
same thing as the price of 1 of Martin's bouquets. So you could view this
as the price of 2 violets plus the price of 4 tulips
plus another violet. So it's really the price
of 3 violets and 4 tulips. So let's check our answer. We got it right.
