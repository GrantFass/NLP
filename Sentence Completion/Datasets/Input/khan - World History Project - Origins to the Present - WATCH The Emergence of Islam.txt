1.8 billion people around the world are&nbsp;
Muslims. That's almost one of every four&nbsp;&nbsp; humans alive right now. I live here in&nbsp;
Abu Dhabi, a city on the Arabian Peninsula where most of the citizens follow&nbsp;
the Muslim faith known as Islam. Islam is a monotheistic tradition which means&nbsp;
that Muslims believe in a single god, Allah. Muslims believe that a man named Muhammad who&nbsp;lived in the Arabian Peninsula in the 7th century CE received a revelation from god, a holy book&nbsp;
called the Quran. In the decades that followed, Muhammad traveled from Mecca across the Arabian&nbsp;Peninsula, gaining followers and establishing the beliefs and traditions of one of the world's great&nbsp;
religions. The core belief and practices of Islam are called the Five Pillars. One, declaring&nbsp;
faith in god and in Muhammad as god's Prophet. Two, practicing regular daily prayers. Three,&nbsp;
fasting during the sacred month of Ramadan. Four, giving charity to the poor. 
Five,&nbsp;performing the pilgrimage to Mecca if one is able. Islam is a diverse religion practiced in many&nbsp;
different cultures and each has left their own, distinct mark on the religion. Since the death&nbsp;
of Muhammad, Muslim communities have interpreted Islam in unique ways, crafting narratives about&nbsp;
their common history from Muhammad to the present. Some narratives are created by Muslims, some&nbsp;
by people outside of Muslim communities. Some of these narratives are tied to political&nbsp;
goals as well, so it's important for historians to think critically about these narratives. Where&nbsp;
does the history of Islam begin? Why did it spread to so many different places? How did it become&nbsp;
significant on a world historical scale? Finally,&nbsp;what historical narratives unite all these diverse&nbsp;traditions? People tell a lot of stories about Islam. I'm sure you've heard some of them. It can&nbsp;
be hard to sift through what's reliable and what's full of misinformation. That's one of the reasons&nbsp;
that expertise is important. Historians can help us evaluate narratives of the past, whether those&nbsp;
stories were created 1400 years ago or yesterday. People with expertise can help us&nbsp;
identify which narratives are useful&nbsp;&nbsp; and which are trying to use us. So I went out&nbsp;
and found an expert. Dr. Mariam Sheibani teaches about the history and culture of Islam at&nbsp;
the University of Toronto. I asked her to help me explore the emergence of Islam and&nbsp;
how narratives shape our understanding of it. Dr. Sheibani, thanks for joining us. Thank you&nbsp;
very much it's an honor to be here with you&nbsp;today. Can you give us a timeline and location for&nbsp;
the early history and context for Islam? So Islam emerged after the Prophet Muhammad established&nbsp;the new religion. He was in the Arabian Peninsula, and he died in 632, and within a decade&nbsp;
his followers had spread Islam to Iraq, to Syria, to Egypt, and into present-day&nbsp;
Iran and Central Asia. So Islam emerges from the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad who was born and&nbsp;lived his entire life in the Arabian Peninsula. At the time, the Arabian Peninsula was primarily&nbsp;
polytheistic, but there were really important Jewish and Christian communities, particularly&nbsp;
Jewish communities in the region. What are the&nbsp;Quran and the Hadith? So the Quran is the Muslim&nbsp;holy book which Muslims believe is the speech of god, the revelations that god revealed to Muhammad&nbsp;
through the Archangel Gabriel and the Hadith are reports of the statements of the Prophet that&nbsp;are not revelation from God directly as well as reports from the early Muslim community, the early&nbsp;Muslims. So it's not just things the Prophet said, but things that the early caliphs, the early&nbsp;
Muslims also said or did. So the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet make it really clear that&nbsp;
the Prophet is renewing the teachings of Abraham and continuing and renewing the teachings of&nbsp;
Judaism and Christianity as well,  and so the Prophet in fact retains certain aspects of the&nbsp;faith and practice that the Jews and Christians were already engaged in, but also introduces new&nbsp;
teachings that are unique or particular to Islam. After his revelation and conquest, Muhammad went&nbsp;
from being a merchant living in a small town of Mecca to being the spiritual and political leader&nbsp;
of a new community. Shortly after Muhammad's death, this small community would spread far&nbsp;
beyond Mecca and Medina. Muhammad's followers conquered the entire Arabian Peninsula and&nbsp;
within a few decades had conquered lands that lay hundreds of miles to the east and west. An Islamic&nbsp;
empire was now stretching from Spain to India. But there were growing pains. The Muslim community&nbsp;struggled to organize its spiritual and political life after Muhammad died in 632 CE. Let's&nbsp;
talk more with Dr. Sheibani about this history. How did early Muslims organize their community&nbsp;
after the death of the Prophet? The early Muslim community faced a lot of challenges after the&nbsp;death of the Prophet. From the historical record,&nbsp;&nbsp; we know that it was in some ways a surprise or a&nbsp;
shock to them after the Prophet had passed away. There were some early debates and discussions&nbsp;
about how the community should organize itself and who should lead the community after the Prophet.&nbsp;
Should it be a member of his household? Should it be prominent political leaders in the community?&nbsp;But eventually, they arrived at a caliphate which is basically a representative of the Prophet who&nbsp;
presides over the community, governs the community both politically and also religiously&nbsp;
in the early period. The early community&nbsp;had to mature relatively quickly especially&nbsp;after the spread of Islam and the expansion of the Islamic empire to these diverse regions&nbsp;
where the communities were primarily non-Muslims. And part of that dynamic was also the absorption&nbsp;
of a lot of other religious communities, a lot of cultures that were very different than the first&nbsp;
Muslim community in the Arabian Peninsula. How did Islam go from a small community in Arabia to a&nbsp;religion that has 1.8 billion adherents around the&nbsp;world? Yeah, that's a good question, and that's a&nbsp;
process that took over 1400 years. But briefly, I&nbsp;can tell you that conversion to Islam in the early&nbsp;period was quite slow. So even though Muslims were ruling over places like Iraq and Syria and Egypt,&nbsp;
the majority of the population hadn't converted to Islam for decades, sometimes even centuries. 
The&nbsp;spread of Islam to regions where Muslims are very numerous today like Indonesia, Malaysia, the&nbsp;
Malay archipelago, sub-saharan Africa. The spread of Islam to these regions actually happened&nbsp;quite late starting primarily in the 13th, 14th, quite a bit after the 15th century. And that&nbsp;
happened through these merchants and tradesmen and traveling mystics who went to these regions&nbsp;
and introduced Islam in the Medieval Period. How did Islam reorganize communities and&nbsp;
networks, both regionally and globally? Muslims in these diverse regions they established&nbsp;
really important urban centers that were very cosmopolitan places, like Iraq, places like&nbsp;
Cairo, like Damascus. They became these magnets for people coming from diverse regions and so&nbsp;
there was a process of first of all assimilating the local cultures, the Byzantine cultures, the&nbsp;
Sasanian cultures that had preceded Islam and there was a very interesting kind of integration&nbsp;
of maybe Islamic values and religious norms with these preceding civilizations, these preceding&nbsp;
cultures that developed a very unique local&nbsp;culture. These cosmopolitan centers, these&nbsp;
urban centers were really important for cultural and intellectual production. The other&nbsp;
important dynamic is the connection of disparate communities through economic and trade network, 
Indian Ocean trade for example, the Silk Road. Because of these trade routes, Islam continued&nbsp;
to spread to these regions that were further away from the Arabian Peninsula, as well as the&nbsp;
development of shared methods of economic exchange and shared social norms. The influence of Islam&nbsp;
continued to expand for centuries beyond his death. Islamic empires conquered new lands and expanded&nbsp;old trade routes. Many of the people they encountered chose to convert to this new religion,&nbsp;reshaping life across Afro-Eurasia during this era. Clearly, Islam is important to the study of&nbsp;history. 
So how do historians study Islam? Where do we get our narratives about early Islam? And what&nbsp;sources do Muslims use to understand their faith and practice their religion?Let's bring&nbsp;
these questions back to our expert. What are some of the different ways the history&nbsp;
of Islam has been told? So although historians disagree about some of the details surrounding&nbsp;Islamic history, as they do about any historical&nbsp;account, there's a consensus among scholars about&nbsp;
a few things, that the Prophet Muhammad existed, that he lived in Arabia, that he claimed to have&nbsp;
received revelation from god, and that Islam spread to these regions outside of the Arabian&nbsp;Peninsula, Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Central Asia,&nbsp;pretty quickly.  What are the most important&nbsp;
sources in Islam for Muslims and historians? The most important sources for Muslims in learning&nbsp;
about their history are the Quran, which is the&nbsp;&nbsp; Muslim holy book, as well as the Hadith reports,
which are accounts or anecdotes about the Prophet and the early community, things that they did, the&nbsp;
things that they said, and these Hadith reports&nbsp;&nbsp; were compiled into historical chronicles as early&nbsp;
as the 9th century and their way of documenting&nbsp;&nbsp; the biography, the life of the Prophet, and the life&nbsp;
of the early Muslim community after the Prophet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Historians do rely on these sources, the Quran 
and the Hadith reports, in addition to which they&nbsp;&nbsp; try to corroborate that narrative through other&nbsp;
sources like archaeological evidence. So early on, these sources were transmitted orally for&nbsp;one or two generations. They were written down in private collections that were later&nbsp;
compiled into collections of Hadith reports, compilations that we still have today and&nbsp;
that historians and Muslims both rely upon to construct and understand the early history&nbsp;
of Islam. It was an oral culture, and so people would memorize these reports and they would retain&nbsp;them in their memory and transmit them to others, in addition to writing them down&nbsp;
and preserving them in writing. Historical narratives about early Islam&nbsp;
remain important to many communities today. There are lots of different narratives and&nbsp;
not all are historically accurate. These come from within and outside Muslim communities, and they often have a political purpose. My conversation with our historical expert Dr.&nbsp;
Sheibani helped me understand why it's important&nbsp;&nbsp; to evaluate these narratives. Today, there are&nbsp;
a lot of Muslim communities all over the world. Islam is a major force in global affairs.&nbsp;
Historical narratives about Islam's emergence and development over the past 14 centuries&nbsp;
shapes our understanding of the world today.
