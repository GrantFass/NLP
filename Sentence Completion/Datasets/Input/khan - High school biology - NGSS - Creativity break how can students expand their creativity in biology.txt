(bright music) (keyboard clacking) - I'd encourage every single one of you to spend some time immersed
in a different culture or maybe even spend some time working in a totally different part of the world from where you grew up. And... It doesn't have to be quite that drastic. It could be as simple as
investing in relationships with people from other parts of the world. And while you're at it, I'd encourage you to learn
a different language. Both of those experiences, I think, will stretch your mind in ways that help you consider
other possibilities. - Students can expand their creative and scientific skill sets by thinking beyond the classroom
and beyond the textbook, using that information from classroom and from the textbook and from other formal information sources, and expanding that to learn
more about both today's world and the world that you
imagine for the future. That involves using those skills such as communication,
and problem-solving, and critical thinking to wonder not just about
what is already known, but to wonder about what is not yet known, which involves using creativity
to think and to wonder. And that also means
communicating with other people to see how wanna shape the world as well. (bright music)
