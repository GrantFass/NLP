So this stabilizer bar
that we're going to create is going to be made
out of a paper clip. And basically, we're just
going to use the paper clip to help keep the bot from
rocking back and forth when it moves around on the table. That will help to
conserve the power, and it will also
move more smoothly. So most of the weight is
carried by the wheels, but every once in
awhile, when the bot moves forward or backward
quickly, it tilts. And so this bar is
going to help to keep it from tilting too much. And that'll help to
prolong battery life and make it move more smoothly. So right now, we're just
bending it in a big giant C. And we're going to take that C
shape and bend the ends down. And that basically just
gives us more to tape onto. So we're going to use
some electrical tape to connect our stabilizer bar. And in order to get
it to work right, we need to put two little
bumps at the bottom so that it can sort
of hold our bot up. And this takes a
lot of adjusting. If the bar sticks down too
far, the bot won't move. And if it doesn't
stick down far enough, it will continue to rock. So really, you kind of
have to trial and error your way through it. But once you do, you can get
the bot to move really smoothly. And it'll only tilt
just a slight amount.
