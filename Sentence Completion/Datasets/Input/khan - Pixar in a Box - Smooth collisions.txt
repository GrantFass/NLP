(springy bounce) - Hey, welcome back. You probably noticed that
the ping pong ball stimulator looks a little more like sand than water. For instance, the balls can
pile up on each other like this. We used a stimulation much
like this in Finding Dory. For instance, the sand in this shot. And the East Australian
current in this shot. To create more water-like stimulation, we need to remove the hard
boundary of the balls. They don't just bounce
off like ping pong balls. They kind of smush together
to create a soft collision. The smooth collisions are an approximation of the pressure forces that
water normally experiences. There's a fancy name for
this kind of stimulation. It's called "smoothed
particle hydrodynamics" or "SPH" for short. Hydrodynamics literally
means the motion of fluids. Now let's look at how lots
of smooth particles interact. We can control how the particles collide using this parameter
called Collision softness. Okay, so this is getting pretty close. Another parameter we can
control is called Viscosity. Viscosity is a measure of
how easily things flow. Fluids with low viscosity like water, flow pretty freely as we see here. Fluids with high viscosity
like honey, flow more slowly. Like this. (water rippling) The more particles you add,
the more computation is needed and the slower the program responds. (slow motion water ripple) Here's an example of
SPH from Finding Nemo. It takes place inside
the mouth of a whale. We've drawn the particles as balls here so you can watch their motion. In the next exercise,
you'll get some practice experimenting with these
different parameters to get a wide range of behaviors. See you soon!
