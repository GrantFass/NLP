So in this video,
we're going to show you how to attach and adjust
the bezel on the tap light. And so the reason
you have to adjust it is that the
wires for each bot are going to be
slightly different and so you have to kind of
move them around a little bit to get the bezel to
sit flat and correctly. So you can see that there's
a number of different wires there. And you have to
bend the wires out of the way to get everything
to connect correctly. So I had a little bit of trouble
getting those to sit down and part of the reason is these
bosses, those little parts that stick out, the screw bosses
were bumping against the wire. So I had to sort of move the
wires around and adjust it. And so it's not
an exact science. It'll take a little
bit of trial and error. But once you have it to
where it sits pretty flat and it's in the center,
you can make sure that all the wires are
still connected there. You can see the
power is flowing. And then I just put a little
bit of hot glue in it. And then I'll tilt
the thing to the side so that the hot glue
runs up against the joint between the bezel and the base. And we should have our
bezel held in place. And that will allow us
to protect our wires and give the bot a
nice finished look.
