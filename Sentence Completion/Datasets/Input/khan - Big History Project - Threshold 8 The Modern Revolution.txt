NARRATOR: Threshold eight began
about 200 years ago and we're living
in the middle of it. We call it
the modern revolution because it created
the world we live in today. Some geologists call the
modern era the anthropocene. That's the era in which the
Earth came to be dominated by a single species, us. How did we suddenly
get to be so powerful? First, we became
a global species. After the year 1500,
human societies began to link up across the world. This created huge
exchange networks in which ideas, technologies,
goods and belief systems could be shared. Because collective
learning worked on a larger scale than ever
before, innovation speeded up. A second ingredient
played a crucial role-- our discovery of
new sources of energy. The fossil fuels--
coal, oil and natural gas-- came from fossilized plants
and organisms that had stored the energy from sunlight over
hundreds of millions of years. Humans learned
how to use that energy to power engines of all kinds. Eventually, we learned
how to extract energy from nuclear reactions
like those that drive the sun. Globalization,
increased innovation and new energy sources allowed us to build the largest
and most complex societies that had ever existed. Today, billions
of people around the world can instantly communicate
with each other. With abundant energy,
a vast range of new materials from plastics
to semiconductors, and an astonishing
number of new machines, many humans live
better than ever before. However, all of this new
complexity has consequences. The energy and the food
we produce has to support nearly seven billion people. That requires a huge portion
of the Earth's resources. Human technology
and activity is literally transforming the biosphere. We may be powerful, but are we
really in charge of our power? What lies ahead
for our own species and for the biosphere
as a whole?
