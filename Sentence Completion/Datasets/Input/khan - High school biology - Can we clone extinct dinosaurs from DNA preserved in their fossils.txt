Despite all of what you see in movies and
science fiction, and some of its very entertaining, and you know some nice
ideas in there, tantalizing ideas, we cannot clone a dinosaur. We cannot create a  Jurassic Park. For a
number of reasons first there isn't a lot of DNA preserved in the ancient fossils, and that
that is, is severely damaged. We're nowhere near ever finding a whole genome for an extinct
dinosaur. Maybe in a few years, maybe down the line, we
might finally get some really reliable evidence on a DNA sequence from a dinosaur, from some tissue of an ancient dinosaur, but
it will only be a  tiny, tiny smattering of  that huge genome. It could be as
many as thirty thousand genes, and we might get a
signal from a couple of them, and that certainly won't be enough to
clone a dinosaur. So I think  the answer to this
question is it's impossible to clone a dinosaur.
