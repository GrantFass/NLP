I thought about using
Velcro for doing this and actually tried
sticking Velcro on the back of the
batteries, but they tended to not stay very well. So as I put this in,
I want to make sure that I loop it like this so that
that top part is facing upward, and that'll mean that
as I pull this through, it'll give it a nice,
tight fit on the back side. All right. So you don't have to tighten
it down all the way just yet, but you should get
it pretty tight. It should be definitely
not moving around. The batteries should be
pretty firmly planted in their location. Yeah. That's pretty good there. All right. And we'll get the
other one through. And again, we want to orient
everything the same way just because if you put
the zip tie the other way, it will not sit tightly
against the battery. All right. It's fairly important when you
mount the batteries that those are in the center, or
pretty close to the center of the device, because it's
where most of the weight is. So when you need
to take these out, you can press it over to side
and pull the batteries out. It's not super easy, but
it'll hold them pretty well, and it's fairly, like
I said, inexpensive. OK, so once you've got that
pulled to a level of-- you want to make sure
it's really tight, because that plastic
will loosen over time. And just cut it off like that.
