- [Narrator] Does the
president's party usually gain or lose seats at the midterm elections? - It's a pretty strong historical trend that the president's party
loses seats in the presidency. So that's particularly the case in the House of Representatives. Since the Civil War,
about 93% of the time, the president's party loses seats. Now sometimes they lose a lot of seats and the entire control
of the House switches from control in the president's party to control into the other party. In the Senate it's a little less direct. About 70% of the time,
the president's party loses seats in a midterm election. And this is often seen, and
more in more recent history, it's really seen as a kinda
thumbs up or thumbs down vote on how the president is doing. The electorate reacting to
whether they like or dislike what the president is doing. And in the two cases recently, where the president's
party did pick up seats in Congress, it was in
1998 when the Republicans were seen to have overreached
in their impeachment of Bill Clinton, and so
voters voted for Democrats, Bill Clinton's party. And then in 2002 when
George W. Bush was seen as successfully responding
to the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon and America, his party picked up seats in
the Congressional election because it was seen as a ratification of his presidency so far.
