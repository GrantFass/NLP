So this is our 38 kilohertz
IR receiver module. And it works with our universal
remote that you can see here. And you can see it lighting up
as we push different buttons. And that's the same
remote we took apart in our reverse
engineering videos. So we're going to plug
this into our bread board, and then we're going
to bend it back. And the reason we're
bending it back is that it allows
you to trigger it from more different
locations in the room. And the lead that is on the
left hand side when you're looking at the
Bit-zee Bot is the one that we want to connect to
our Arduino, digital pin out number 12. So we're running that straight
back to our digital pin out. And then we're going to connect
the other two leads, the center and the one on the right, to
our positive and our ground. So we've got a ground pin
there on the front side of our Arduino. And we're just going to run that
black wire, which is our ground wire, to that ground
on our Arduino. And right now, we're just
sort of sizing the wiring. And that goes to the center
of our IR receiver module. And then there's also a
five volt out positive. So we're going to connect that
to our receiver module as well. And we're connecting
that to the leg on the right side of
the receiver module and, again, to the
five volts out. And now we're going
to test our module. We've already loaded some code. And we're going to push
our forward button. And you can see it's
running our motors there, so that's working. We'll provide the
code in our videos that talk about the Arduino.
