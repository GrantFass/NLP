Let's say you're watching the opening parade&nbsp;
of the Olympic Games, hundreds of individuals marching together each under their own&nbsp;
banners, all wearing matching outfits. Which team will you be rooting for? Why?&nbsp;
Did you say because they're from my country or that's where my ancestors came from.&nbsp;
Maybe you just like the flag. Let's think about that for a second. Why&nbsp;
does any of that matter to you? You've probably never met any of these people.&nbsp;
They're most likely not from your hometown, and I'm guessing you're not a world-class swimmer&nbsp;
or shot putter. Why do you care whether these individuals win a game being played thousands of&nbsp;
miles away? Your answer to that question probably reveals your participation in the most impactful&nbsp;
ideology of the last 200 years: nationalism. Nationalism is an ideology that makes it&nbsp;
possible for millions of people, including you, who have never and will never meet each other&nbsp;
to care about one another, to share a common goal, to kill and to die for each other. Nationalism&nbsp;
is the belief that the borders of a state should match the homeland of a people,&nbsp;
a nation. That might seem obvious to you. Today, most everyone in the world is a citizen&nbsp;
of a nation-state, but in the late 18th century nation was a pretty radical idea. In the&nbsp;
year 1750, most people identified locally with their family or village or possibly&nbsp;
with a larger religious community. People were used to being governed by someone&nbsp;
foreign, usually a monarch or an emperor, but that all started to change at the end of the 18th&nbsp;
century when an age of revolutions reshaped power in the Atlantic world. Now before we get ahead&nbsp;
of ourselves, let's define what nationalism is. Nationalism is both a cultural and political&nbsp;
project, and it makes two big arguments: first, that nations exist and second, that&nbsp;
nations have a right to govern themselves. The political scientist Benedict Anderson defined&nbsp;
the nation as an imagined political community. That's the cultural part of nationalism. It's&nbsp;
the "that's my team" part. Nationalism asserts that nations exist, like the Italian nation&nbsp;
or the Nigerian nation, but you can't touch&nbsp;&nbsp; or hold a nation. It's something that a group of&nbsp;
people collectively believe in, but just because it exists only in people's imaginations doesn't&nbsp;
make the idea any less powerful. Unlike empires, nations are imagined as having a right to govern&nbsp;themselves within the border of some ancient homeland. This idea is called a nation-state,&nbsp;
a sovereign state whose citizens are members of the same nation, but believing something&nbsp;
doesn't make it real. Why has nationalism been so powerful in the past two centuries?&nbsp;
Why do we live in a world of nation states? Nationalism has made a lot of people believe&nbsp;
very deeply in the idea that they are part of the same community and that their nationality&nbsp;
is the most important part of their identity. Millions of people might believe in the same&nbsp;
nation. Like you and those Olympic athletes, most of them will never meet each other.&nbsp;
Their societies might be terribly unequal, and yet in their minds they all believe they're&nbsp;
citizens of the same great nation. This belief makes it possible for millions of strangers to&nbsp;
share common goals and common identities. It has made millions of strangers willing to fight,&nbsp;
to kill, and to die for each other. So that's a powerful idea, and it has thoroughly reshaped&nbsp;
our world, so let's explore how that happened. Benedict Anderson traced the&nbsp;
beginnings of modern nationalism to the Atlantic revolutions of the late 18th and&nbsp;
early 19th century. There might have been some isolated examples of nationalism earlier, but when&nbsp;
European colonies in the Americas stopped thinking of themselves as subjects of European monarchs&nbsp;
and started to think of themselves as a nation, that really got the nationalism ball rolling. The&nbsp;
French Revolution took these ideas flowing around the Atlantic and put them together into&nbsp;
a comprehensive ideology of nationalism. As the French rose up and fired their king by&nbsp;
decapitating him, the revolutionary government desperately needed to unify their citizens in&nbsp;
the face of threats from other European monarchs. They promoted French culture and French&nbsp;
language. Thanks to universal conscription, military service became a national duty for every&nbsp;
male citizen. Nationalist passions helped Napoleon build his armies and launch his conquests.&nbsp;
However, as Napoleon swept across Europe, the presence of French conquerors inspired&nbsp;
conquered peoples to adopt their own nationalisms as a strategy of resistance. It went something&nbsp;
like this. Hey, why do our oppressors keep telling us their team France? Can't we&nbsp;
just form a team Italy and kick them out? The forces of nationalism, once they were&nbsp;
unleashed, were hard to contain.  Now nationalism was straightforward in a country like France,&nbsp;which had a centralized government and relatively well-defined borders, and they'd already cut&nbsp;
off their king's head, so they had a head start, but other nations weren't so lucky. In places like&nbsp;
Italy and Germany, nationalists struggled to unify many different principalities, city-states, and&nbsp;
kingdoms into a single nation. In other places, nationalists rose up within large multi-ethnic&nbsp;empires, demanding their own nation-state made up of Hungarians, Serbians, Greeks,&nbsp;
Turks, Czechs, Romanians, Ukrainians, and many others. But no one seemed to quite agree&nbsp;
on what territory belonged to which nation or even who should lead that nation, and so the&nbsp;
19th century saw many wars as nations unified and empires crumbled. From the Atlantic revolutions,&nbsp;
nationalism spread around the globe. Nationalists in Egypt, Japan, India, China, and elsewhere&nbsp;
imagined and demanded their own nations. Nationalism spread like wildfire in the 19th&nbsp;
century, but it was the extreme violence of the 20th century that made nationalism the most&nbsp;
important ideology in modern history. World War One was caused in part by a Serbian nationalist&nbsp;
who assassinated the Austrian archduke, but it was also caused by increasing nationalist&nbsp;
competition among Europe's great powers. Extreme forms of nationalism made possible some of the&nbsp;
greatest atrocities in human history including the Armenian Genocide and the many horrors of&nbsp;
the Second World War, particularly the Holocaust. After the Second World War, a new wave of&nbsp;
nationalism swept the world as colonized peoples liberated themselves from empire and formed&nbsp;
their own nations. Today in the 21st century, nationalism continues to evolve. New technologies&nbsp;
make communication and travel easier, and many argue that this makes new transnational&nbsp;
identities even more significant, but others still point to the troubling resurgence of militant&nbsp;
nationalism, which embraces racism and xenophobia. Nationalism is less than three centuries old&nbsp;
and for a species that only started building cities about 50 centuries ago that makes it&nbsp;
pretty new, but it's also constructed on some ideas that are very old. Nationalists search for&nbsp;
common historical experiences that link different groups of people together. Shared language,&nbsp;
cultural traditions, and religion have all helped nationalists create the idea that modern&nbsp;
nations have deep connections to the past, and well if a deep connection didn't&nbsp;
really exist, nationalists just created it. Nationalist thinkers and politicians created&nbsp;
myths and histories that supported the idea of their nation. They promoted public&nbsp;
education and rituals like national anthems and pledges of allegiance that promoted national&nbsp;
unity and national identities. These ideas spread around the world quickly thanks to the rise of&nbsp;
mass printing and more literate populations. So here's the question. Is nationalism good or&nbsp;
bad? Nationalism makes it possible for millions of strangers to unify on a massive scale. It allows&nbsp;
people who have never met to cooperate with and&nbsp;&nbsp; even die for one another. Nationalism offered a&nbsp;
revolutionary ideology that has liberated millions of people from the rule of kings and empires, but&nbsp;
nationalism has also caused a lot of conflicts and atrocities since the long 19th century. That's&nbsp;
because once people started defining who belonged in a nation, they also started defining who was&nbsp;
not a part of that nation. Foreigners, political enemies, and minorities became frequent targets&nbsp;of nationalists. In some places, nationalists defined membership to the nation along racial&nbsp;
or ethnic lines. Other places excluded women. Often those considered foreign, like Jews in Nazi&nbsp;
Germany, were persecuted, murdered, and expelled from their homes. Nationalism demands that the&nbsp;
nation come above all other identities. Frequently, this has driven nations to war as they compete&nbsp;
for the same territory or for national prestige. Even today, millions of people in&nbsp;
Kurdistan, Basque, Spain, Quebec, Angola, Tibet, and many other places believe&nbsp;
that they should have their own nation-state. Many continue to fight and to die for this&nbsp;
belief. For better and for worse, we live in a world of nation-states. Nationalism has&nbsp;
provoked some of humanity's greatest atrocities as well as our greatest triumphs. It's an ideology&nbsp;
that both empowers and subjugates. Nationalism is probably here to stay, so in the future can&nbsp;
we imagine forms of nationalism that unite, rather than divide? Is it possible for a world&nbsp;
of many different nations to cooperate toward shared goals in an era where challenges like&nbsp;
climate change transcend our national borders? So is nationalism good bad or both? That's up to you to decide for yourself using&nbsp;
evidence that you find in this course and beyond.
