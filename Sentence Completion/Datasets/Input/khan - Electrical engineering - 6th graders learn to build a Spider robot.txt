VICKI LOMBARDI: So
today we're going to start building the robots. We're going to
first watch a video. We're going to watch them
all together at once. But you and your partner will be
watching them at your own pace to help you with the steps. So first you're going to
desolder the LED light resistor and black wire. And when you watch the video
again, it'll make sense. You're going to heat these two
dots up and pull out your LED. And pull. There you go. SPEAKER 1: I took out the LED. Woo, and I just dropped the LED. VICKI LOMBARDI: And you need
to strip off about a quarter to a half an inch of
insulation on both sides. SPEAKER 2: Wait, but
it's not all the way out. SPEAKER 3: Oh, OK. There it is. SPEAKER 2: We didn't
take it all out. We kind of snapped
the motherboard, so we have to take the
rest out right now. SPEAKER 3: Yeah. SPEAKER 2: Yeah. We're just going to
throw it away anyway since it's the light bulb, and
we don't need the light bulb. SPEAKER 3: Yeah, we do. SPEAKER 2: No. OK, and now we're going to
watch the rest of the video to see what we should do next. SPEAKER 4: We had a
bit too much wire, so we put electrical
tape over it. It really helped. Oh, I can't get it. There, you got it. SPEAKER 5: I think we're
screwing it the wrong way. Aha! SPEAKER 6: Yay! SPEAKER 5: Yay! SPEAKER 7: This is the
light for it to blink. I have no idea what this is. SPEAKER 8: Nor do I. KARL R. C. WENDT: What
does it look like? What does it remind you of? SPEAKER 8: A bug. It does. SPEAKER 7: It looks like a
CPU thing for the computer. VICKI LOMBARDI: What's
the rule with these? SPEAKER 9: The rule
for those is you always have to have them on
because something could go flying at your face, and
you have protection from that. VICKI LOMBARDI: To
show them and then have them be able to do
it gave them confidence. KARL R. C. WENDT: Right. VICKI LOMBARDI: And
then when they did it, they felt very successful
and proud of themselves. Because I said, this is
where I struggled the most. SPEAKER 10: Will you help me? SPEAKER 11: Yeah. VICKI LOMBARDI: You
need to watch the video, because this is
not your next step. SPEAKER 12 : So it's
opposite, right? SPEAKER 11: That's it. Yes, nice job. Wow, great. VICKI LOMBARDI: Would you
mind going back and watching the video and seeing how
you place your wires? I see that the numbers
are faced up on this side, but face down here. What side do they need to
be faced up on and why, and where do the wires go? SPEAKER 12 : They
go in the-- oh. VICKI LOMBARDI: Yeah. And if we bridge that gap,
what's going to happen? SPEAKER 12 : Then it's
going to come loose. VICKI LOMBARDI: Yeah. So what side do the
need to be facing up? Perfect. And it needs to be
how many inches apart? SPEAKER 12 : Two and a half. VICKI LOMBARDI: Yeah. KARL R. C. WENDT: So where
the wires go into the motors, some of them don't loop them
right and so they'll fall out. Because the loop should have a
little bit of a twist in it so it pushes against the
metal tab on the motor. But it's a subtlety that's
maybe lost in the video. KAREN WILSON: We
watched that part about how to twist that wire. And that's when he said, he
goes, oh, I know what he did. I know what he did. And so then he
was able to, and I saw him twisting the
wire to make sure that it went in there. SPEAKER 13: The
wires got pulled out. So once we've already
glued everything together, now we have to try and
put the wires back in, which is actually very hard. SPEAKER 14: Can we put
this one in this side? SPEAKER 13: But the
problem is it's very loose. We might actually have to
solder or hot glue it in. We're going to hot
glue them in place. That should be good. VICKI LOMBARDI: It's
too wide for that hole, but it's a good solution. SPEAKER 15: Oh, to
make it [INAUDIBLE]? VICKI LOMBARDI: OK,
show me what you do. KARL R. C. WENDT:
I do think that it was really exciting to see
the kids go their own way and try it. There were a couple
of students that hadn't done the wire
stripping themselves. They had found other
students to do it. KAMI THORDARSON:
They did outsourcing. KARL R. C. WENDT: All this
time they've been outsourcing. They've been working with
other students [INAUDIBLE]. So I was like, you don't
know how to strip wires? They're like, no. I was like, well, how did
you get it done so far? And they were like, we gave it
to some other kids to do it. SHEENA VAIDYANATHAN: And
they're kids who want this job. You have to understand,
it goes both ways. There's a kid who's itching to
do it-- let me do it for you. KAMI THORDARSON:
Well, and I would hope that for those kids that
are just on this racetrack to finish, and then
they get to the end and stuff doesn't work, that
there's a lesson in that, right? I hope they have some time to
make the connection of, well, I didn't pay close
enough attention. Because a lot of them
don't get an opportunity to learn like this
on their own where they're really responsible. And someone's over
their shoulder every second saying,
no, wait, that's wrong. You need to fix that. So I love the fact that
we took a step back today. And I saw some stuff that I
was like, OK, go with that. See what happens. SHEENA VAIDYANATHAN: The teacher
in you wants to go in and say, did you check? And I'm like, no [INAUDIBLE]. KAMI THORDARSON: Right, just
zip it, don't say anything. SHEENA VAIDYANATHAN: But I think
because we were not saying it, they were watching
the videos a lot more. I was very happy to see that. Like they were
seriously sitting there. KAMI THORDARSON: It took
some self-control though. SHEENA VAIDYANATHAN: It did. But I think that was a good one,
that they actually watched it. KARL R. C. WENDT: Right. SPEAKER 16 : So we're basically
finished with the robot. After this we're
doing programming. SPEAKER 4: Insulators keep
electricity from going through, and conductors
conduct electricity. I thought it would kind
of be easier than this, but I was wrong,
and I like that. SPEAKER 16 : Some challenge. SPEAKER 4: Yeah, it
was really challenging and it was really fun, too. KARL R. C. WENDT:
What advice would you give a couple of kids that
haven't made the robot yet that are going to? SPEAKER 16 : Well,
we'd say try hard. SPEAKER 4: Yeah. Don't go too fast-- you'll
definitely mess up plenty. KARL R. C. WENDT: So
this looks different now. What did you guys do? SPEAKER 17: Before, it
was facing horizontally, and then we made it
so it was vertical. KARL R. C. WENDT: Awesome. And it fits together
better now, right? SPEAKER 18: Yeah, it lays flat. KARL R. C. WENDT: Yeah. Awesome. Good job. VICKI LOMBARDI: It says today
we made a circuit on our switch. What is a circuit? SPEAKER 19: We need to
take off the insulation so the metal can
complete the circuit. SPEAKER 20: And when
we push the switch, it hits a piece of metal
that closes the circuit, and then it can open it, too. VICKI LOMBARDI: This popped out. SPEAKER 21: It did? VICKI LOMBARDI: Look. Where does that need to go? Where do your black wires need
to go in your terminal block? SPEAKER 21: In the center. VICKI LOMBARDI: In the center. Why? SPEAKER 21: Because the center--
these are our negative charges. These are positive. SPEAKER 11: Those
are the power wires, and this is going to tell the
Arduino what to do, basically. I think. SPEAKER 22: I think. I have no idea. SPEAKER 11: OK, so
we've gotten that in. What else? You know the outer
portions of the wire, the yellow parts, insulation? They're basically resistors
so that if the wire touches another wire, the electrons
don't flow to that wire and short out the
circuit or burn it out. SPEAKER 22: And sometimes
it does that, and then there's a link, and then-- SPEAKER 11: Oh, [INAUDIBLE]. SPEAKER 22: Oh,
wow, this is stupid. Every time I show somebody
it works, it doesn't work. VICKI LOMBARDI: If
you try your switch, it should light up, right? What does the switch do, aside
from turning it on and off? SPEAKER 23: The
switch wouldn't work. It would just stay on the
whole time like it is now. SPEAKER 24: Well, we
soldered in the wrong spot where the switch was. It was supposed
to be right here, but then we soldered
right here on accident. SPEAKER 23: It'll work when
the wires are in there. But when we try to turn it off,
it's just going to stay on. SPEAKER 25: The
switch is working. Well, it closes the
circuit, because open is when it won't work. SPEAKER 26: Solder is like
melted metal, kind of. And it glues other
metal pieces together. SPEAKER 27: It's a conductor
because it's metal. SPEAKER 26: OK, is
that good enough? SPEAKER 27: Ours
didn't stick together. SPEAKER 26: We were squeezing
it, and it fell apart. SPEAKER 27: Stuck together? SPEAKER 26: Yeah,
that's perfect. It's like covering
the whole thing. SPEAKER 28: So a
motor controller controls the speed and
direction of the motor, so how fast it turns and
what direction it goes, and so forward and backwards. And you can always enter
that in the program. SPEAKER 29: Something--
it was working. You saw it. And then [INAUDIBLE]. Come on, come on,
robot, I'm begging you. SPEAKER 30: It's OK. SPEAKER 31: Look at mine. SPEAKER 29: Yeah, it just did. SPEAKER 32: Dude,
you lost a wheel. You lost a wheel. [? SPEAKER 22: Nonsense. ?] SPEAKER 32: Whoa, what happened? SPEAKER 33: We lost our
wheel and the LED came out. SPEAKER 9: And an LED came out. Oh, that sucks. SPEAKER 32: Great. Not what we want
to start out like. SPEAKER 34: Just let me look. Copy and paste, and then
change it on the [INAUDIBLE]. SPEAKER 35: So let's
make him move around. SPEAKER 34: And
blink [INAUDIBLE]. And then fight Jedi. SPEAKER 35: No. SPEAKER 34: Why not? KARL R. C. WENDT: Go! Go! ALL: Oh! SPEAKER 36: Where's my shield? Where's my shield? I've created you to
win, not to lose. SPEAKER 39: Hey, look, see that? How it's like, cool. It looks like a
lightsaber kind of. SPEAKER 22: Yeah, right? Oh, that is so epic. SPEAKER 40: Here's what we
have to do is we have to put-- m SPEAKER 40: We basically
just finished it today, and we didn't have enough time,
so we had to just tape it, and that doesn't work very well. So when we get back to
science, we'll superglue it, and it will work then. KARL R. C. WENDT:
Of course it will. SPEAKER 42: Is that yours? SPEAKER 43: Yep. SPEAKER 44: [INAUDIBLE] battery. SPEAKER 45: Whoever likes
R2D2, raise their hands.
