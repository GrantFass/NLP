- [Instructor] How did
Ronald Reagan's policies affect the government and economy? - What Ronald Reagan believed
is that good programs, he had been a New Deal democrat, he believed that what had happened was good programs that had
tried to help people who needed the help, the
poor, the infirm, the elderly, those programs had ballooned,
and what had happened was they were no longer prioritizing help to those who needed
it, but they had become a kind of system where those
who made the loudest noise got the most government,
got the most money and got the attention from the government, and that that in fact stopped
helping people in need and ended up hurting
people, ended up sort of entrapping them in government dependence. And so what he said was he was
going to do two big things. Or three big things actually. He was going to cut taxes,
and what that was going to do was shrink the amount of available money towards government, which
he was then going to also do by cutting spending, and he
was going to cut regulation. So it was essentially
paring down government, which he thought was inefficient towards giving resources to those who need it, he wanted a lot of that power
to go back to the states, and he also believed
in an economic program that both cut money from domestic spending but also cut taxes, which he believed would actually generate more revenue because of something called
supply-side economics, and so his both economic theory and his theory about shrinking government were kind of matched
up in his first budget and in his first major tax cut.
