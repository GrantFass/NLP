(jazzy music) - [Voiceover] The ancient
Etruscans built temples that in some ways looked
like Greek and Roman temples but are also distinct. - [Voiceover] But when we
look at them from the front, they certainly look like
ancient Greek temples. But they're really different. - [Voiceover] For one thing,
the Etruscans did not use the Greek orders, that is
doric, or ionic, or corinthian. For another, they had very deep porches and the temples tended to be more square. - [Voiceover] And
they're not made of stone the way ancient Greek temples were. - [Voiceover] We're
looking at the fragments of four large scale terra cota figures from the temple at Veii, which was a principle
city of the Etruscans. And we're seeing them in
the Etruscan museum in Rome. - [Voiceover] In ancient
Greek architecture, we might expect to see figures like
this occupy the pediment. But instead, these
figures lined the rooftop. - [Voiceover] And like
ancient Greek sculpture, they were very highly painted. - [Voiceover] So it's such an
interesting moment in Italy in the 6th century. We have Greek colonies
in the south of Italy, we have the Romans in Rome
although ruled by Etruscan kings, and then up in the northern part of Italy we have a confederacy of about
a dozen Etruscan city states. So Italy is a complicated
place in the 6th century B.C.E. - [Voiceover] These are
slightly larger than life. And although they were
placed equidistantly, they do enact a specific scene. - [Voiceover] This is a scene
from ancient Greek mythology. It's the third labor of Hercules. Hercules is sent out to capture a very large deer with golden horns. Now, this deer is very special
to the goddess Artemis. And actually the idea is that the person who sent Hercules on this
labor wants to annoy Artemis. - [Voiceover] So then
she punishes Hercules. Now Hercules is known in the
original Greek is Herakles. And he's shown here with
the golden hind under him. He has been able to capture it
and now he's being confronted by both Artemis and her brother Apollo. - [Voiceover] They want the deer back. - [Voiceover] And so Hercules
promises to release it once he shows it to the king
who sent him on this labor. - [Voiceover] Something we
find in Etruscan sculpture is this sense of movement and liveliness. We see that in the sarcophagus
of the spouses, for example. And we see that here with
the figure of Apollo, who is striding forward. And Hercules too, whose
body is leaning forward and whose knee is raised. We see that sense of
musculature and animation. - [Voiceover] These are terra
cotta, that is they're clay. So they would've been modeled
in an additive process. - [Voiceover] Apollo
wears that archaic smile that we're used to seeing
from the Carros figures. But he's still very different
than the Greek figures. His smile is a little bit more animated, his proportions of his body are different. - [Voiceover] And the look
on this face is not one that is looking out into
a generalized space, he is catching the eye of Hercules. He is engaged directly,
and therefore engages us. - [Voiceover] And just like
their faces are stylized, their bodies are also highly stylized. There's almost a sense
of twisting at the hips and the shoulders are
overly rounded and broad. This is not a naturalistic
depiction of the body. - [Voiceover] And the artist
seems to favor detail. For instance, look at the way
that the drapery falls flat, creating these lovely little loops. And look at the marvelous
detail of the feet. This is such a tease, because
here we have this engaging, lively sculpture from a culture whose literature has been lost and who we know so little about. (jazzy music)
