Say an alien came to Earth today and wanted to&nbsp;
learn more about humans. Say this alien decided to meet with a hundred people, everyday, average&nbsp;
randomly selected people, to find out more about our lives and experiences. Statistically, four or&nbsp;
five of those people would likely be Americans. A few other big countries like Brazil, India,&nbsp;
and Indonesia would likely have multiple people&nbsp;selected. Most countries would have one or none,&nbsp;
but about 20 of those people would be Chinese. That's right. One in every five people in&nbsp;
the world, about 1.4 billion human beings, lives in China. That's more than four times as&nbsp;
many as the United States. Hi, I'm Francesca Hodges, and I'm here to talk about China's&nbsp;
increasingly global presence in the 21st century. In many ways, China's story is at the center&nbsp;
of global change over the past two decades. A hundred years ago, China was a country divided&nbsp;
among warlords, occupied by foreign powers, and with much of its population living in poverty. But&nbsp;
in the century that followed, it has become the biggest manufacturer in the world, now producing&nbsp;
many of the goods used by people everywhere. Have a look at this chart showing the rise&nbsp;
of China's gross domestic product per capita, a measure of its economic output per person.&nbsp;
This measure of rising production demonstrates China's growth as probably one of the&nbsp;
biggest success stories of globalization. Arguably, this growing wealth has had a big impact&nbsp;
on the lives of the Chinese people. Here's another&nbsp;&nbsp; pretty revealing chart. It shows the decline&nbsp;
in the percentage of China's population living in extreme poverty between 1990 and 2015.&nbsp;
That decline from above 60 percent of the population to about three percent represents millions of people&nbsp;
raised out of poverty in that 25-year period. But what does all of this change feel like to the&nbsp;Chinese? Has this intense economic growth improved&nbsp;their lives? These are the questions we ask in&nbsp;
this video, and for answers I turn to Dr. Crystal&nbsp;Chang. She is a professor in the Global Studies&nbsp;
department at UC Berkeley where I happen to be a&nbsp;student. Professor Chang, who governs China today?&nbsp;
Today, China is governed by the Chinese Communist&nbsp;Party. Would you describe this governmental system&nbsp;
as democratic, authoritarian, or neither? I would describe the Chinese political system as&nbsp;
authoritarian. When the CCP took control in 1949, they established the People's Republic of&nbsp;
China, and it is authoritarian. The party retains full control over all aspects of Chinese political&nbsp;
life, considerable influence over the economy, and very close surveillance over China's 1.4&nbsp;
billion people. Why do the Chinese people support or allow the party to govern? So let's&nbsp;
start with what life was like in the 1970s. This was the Cultural Revolution. This was a&nbsp;
time when the country was ravaged by political chaos and social chaos, and at that time the&nbsp;
country was very poor, and after the reforms China's middle class grew, incomes grew, and&nbsp;
people's lives materially got much better. And so I tell you that story because there's&nbsp;
sort of an implicit social contract between the Chinese people and the government which&nbsp;
works like this. As long as the government continues to improve people's material&nbsp;
livelihoods and provide social stability,&nbsp;&nbsp; the people allow the government to continue&nbsp;
to be ruled by the Communist Party, and so as long as that relationship holds, the people&nbsp;
are fine with Communist Party rule. Considering China's massive economic expansion, would you&nbsp;say that China has benefited from globalization? I would say China has benefited greatly from&nbsp;
globalization. At first, it attracted a lot of foreign direct investment because China offered&nbsp;
cheap labor and a lot of favorable policies, so a lot of companies from around the world went to&nbsp;
produce goods in China. Then as the country became richer, it became a desirable market, right. There&nbsp;
were many jokes about how what would it be like to sell every Chinese consumer a pencil, and then&nbsp;
it was like what would it be like to sell them a&nbsp;&nbsp; phone, and then what would it be like to sell them&nbsp;
a car, right. So China has the largest automobile market in the world today. You might be surprised&nbsp;
to learn that General Motors, an American company, sells more cars in China than it does in the&nbsp;
United States. So yes, China has been a huge benefactor of globalization, and according&nbsp;
to a lot of big surveys, like the Pew Global Attitude Survey, Chinese people are&nbsp;
much more-they look on globalization much more favorably than Americans do today. How does&nbsp;
the party maintain unity and popular support? Good question. So the Chinese government&nbsp;
uses old-fashioned propaganda actually to maintain a very coherent message, and as a result&nbsp;
they also censor the news, and they try to focus in on a very consistent narrative, which is&nbsp;
everything good in your life is because of the party. That's through the education system,&nbsp;
through what people watch on television,&nbsp;&nbsp; what they consume on the internet. And there&nbsp;
is a lot of censorship on the Chinese internet for any dissent or any opinions that do not fit&nbsp;
within that narrative. You just mentioned that there was dissenting opinion against the Chinese&nbsp;Communist Party. Where does this opposition lie? Well, Francesca, that's a great question.&nbsp;
There really isn't significant opposition, and every time there's a small social movement,&nbsp;
it is quashed by the party. We saw this in 1989 with the Tiananmen protest led by students&nbsp;
and then workers. We've seen this with other small movements like the Falun Gong, which&nbsp;
is a spiritual, quasi-religious movement. We've seen this with small Tibetan uprisings&nbsp;
and uprisings in Xinjiang. Every time there seems to be a small movement growing, the&nbsp;
government quells it pretty substantially. Referring to one of those social movements,&nbsp;
what is happening in Hong Kong as of June 2019? Yeah, so in Hong Kong, you get a pretty good idea&nbsp;
of what happens when citizens challenge the state. Over the last several years actually there have&nbsp;
been a series of protest. Way back when Hong Kong was returned to China, the original agreement&nbsp;
between the British government and the Chinese government was that Hong Kong people would at&nbsp;
some point be able to have an election of their chief executive, but unfortunately the Chinese&nbsp;
government has really not honored that decision. And they have implemented now&nbsp;
a new national security law which basically prohibits all people in Hong Kong&nbsp;
and in China and even in the rest of the world, the language of it, from getting involved in&nbsp;
Hong Kong politics or commenting on Hong Kong politics at all. And they've used this new law&nbsp;
to put several of the young leaders in jail. It's really quite sad to see from the outside.&nbsp;
Speaking about a different social movement in a different geographic location, what have Uyghurs&nbsp;
Muslims been experiencing in recent years? Yeah, so going back quite a few years now, there have&nbsp;
been a few incidents of more radicalized Uyghurs who've acted out against Han Chinese, which is&nbsp;
the ethnic majority in China, and it did lead to a few deaths. And in reaction to those isolated&nbsp;
incidents, the Chinese government has instituted a very broad campaign to basically, what the&nbsp;
Chinese would call, re-educate Uyghurs Muslims, and we know now that over a million Uyghurs&nbsp;
Muslims have been put into labor camps, including women and children. Dr. Chang seemed to paint&nbsp;
two different pictures of the Chinese state, as a force that had improved people's lives but also as&nbsp;
an autocratic interfering government that forced people to conform. I couldn't figure out whether&nbsp;
overall life had improved for the Chinese people over the last century, so I asked Dr. Chang a&nbsp;
few more questions to get her overall assessment. Professor Chang, would you say that life&nbsp;
has improved for the average Chinese citizen over the past few decades? I would say without&nbsp;
a doubt for almost all Chinese people life has improved dramatically over the last century. If&nbsp;
we think back to 1911, China was in a tatters, right. The central government had essentially&nbsp;
lost control over many parts of the country. Economically, people were not doing well.&nbsp;
China's political system was being infringed upon by foreign countries, including the United&nbsp;
States. It was soon to be invaded by Japan. So if we compare today's China with that time,&nbsp;
most people's lives have dramatically improved. Not only that, but parents today feel confident&nbsp;
that the lives of their children will be better than their own lives. That's huge,&nbsp;
right? I think in the developed world that is no longer true in many countries.
However, it's still important to note that the government's control and surveillance over&nbsp;
society is intensifying, and it is infringing on the lives of people who have dissenting opinions&nbsp;
whether that's in Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, or some of China's leading universities.&nbsp;
In those places, people are worried about their future. At least they're worried about the ability&nbsp;
of Chinese people to speak their minds or to give feedback to how their country is governed. That&nbsp;
window is closing. So there's no such thing as free speech or freedom to organize in China.&nbsp;
For most Chinese, they're okay with that, but for those who want to speak out, things are only&nbsp;
going to get more restrictive. Dr. Chang's answer suggested that in her analysis life had improved&nbsp;
for the majority of Chinese people under the rule of the Communist Party. The social contract she&nbsp;
mentioned earlier that the people would support the government as long as it improved their lives&nbsp;
was working for most people, but not for everyone. Those who wanted more political freedoms or to&nbsp;
continue their cultural or religious practices were forced to conform. It's a different system&nbsp;
than from the United States and from most European countries, but because of China's&nbsp;
huge population and economic significance, it's an important part of the global picture&nbsp;
now in this era of intense globalization.
