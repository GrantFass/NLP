So this mock-up
was created to show another part of the circuit. When we turn the switch
here, the power switch, we see both the motors
spin in this direction. They're pulling power
from the battery, and it's flowing
through the motors causing it to spin this way. So you can see that the
ground wire from the battery here is connected to the blue
wire, which goes to the motors. And then that goes to a switch,
and that's connected back to the positive side
on the battery here. So that's causing the motors
to spin in this direction when they're wired like that. Notice the positive
wire here is tied off. We don't need the positive
wire, because we're using this yellow wire to
connect to the batteries. And we just need
this one battery to power these two motors,
because one battery is 1.5 volts and that's enough
to get the motors to turn. And so we're going
to use this battery to make the motors
turn backwards. You can see when we turn it
on the motors spin backwards. Now in this configuration
what we've done is we've created
a mock-up again. And we want to be able
to make the motors again spin forward and backwards,
so this set-up the motors are spinning forwards. So you can see they're
going like this, they're going forward. And the batteries on the
other side, and we're connected to the positive wire
instead of the negative wire, and again the
negative wire is being taken care of because this
wire is coming through here. So what we've done
is we've changed the orientation of the battery. And so the power is flowing
the other direction, causing the motors
to go forward. So if you reverse the
flow of electricity, you can change the direction
of the motor movement.
