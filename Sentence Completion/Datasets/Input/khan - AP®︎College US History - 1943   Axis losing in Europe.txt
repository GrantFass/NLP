In 1943 we see the tide really turns in favor of the allies especially in Europe but it's actually happening in the Pacific as well to begin with in 1943 the siege of Stalingrad which doesn't quite exactly fit on this map but would be right over here it ends with the soviets being notorious and this is actually an incredible story there's many movies about the siege of Stalingrad for a reason the soviets are able to mount a pretty epic counterattack by attacking the flanks of the axis army and their able to push the back and defeat the axis army Stalingrad itself gets reduced to rubble and you know if you actually look up pictures of it its kind of mind blowing to just even imagine what went on there and Stalingrad right over here although right now Leningrad in 1943 still under siege and if you want your stomach to really be sick look up images of things that happened over there but needless to say 1943 its a turning... or its not the turning point '42 really is the turning point but in 1943, the momentum's really in the allies favor the Soviets defeat the Germans at Stalingrad they are able to push the Germans and the axis powers out of the caucases and then they'd begin to advance and then the Soviets begin to advance and retake ground from the axis powers now at the same time you might remember that at the end of 1942 in North Africa in North Africa, let me go right over here I have all these maps layered over here you might remember that the British were able to push back the axis army back into Lybia and then this just continues as we go into 1943 and the allied armies essentially able to kick the axis army out of North Africa be victorious of North Africa you remember you have these the armies that are coming from Egypt you also had allies land in Morocco and Algeria and then they all meet up and by mid-year they're able to use their victory in North Africa as a launching point to start attacking the main land of Italy they first, they can go to Sicily or then they go to the actual main land, and there's an attack at Selerno and they start to really kind of fight their way up the Italian peninsula we're gonna do this in a blue color so you can see this is the allies, as were going to mid- and late- 1943 are able to take more and more of the Italian peninula now as this happens, conditions i Italy aren't good the Italian people aren't happy and they're actually able to depose Mussolini so let me write that down so this is, In 1943 Mussolini, oh i think there's another s, Mussolini is deposed Mussolini is, Mussolini is deposed and as we get later that year, Italy formally surrenders to the allies now with that said, Italy has surrendered but the entire country of Italy the entire peninsula, there's still axis troops there so the allies have to continue  to slog through 1943 and 1944 and even to 1945 to completely rid Italy of the axis powers, and especially the Germans now Rome especially is fairly hard bombing campaigns start in Rome in order to completely get the axis powers out of there and that all is completely happening in 19- this is all happening in 1943 now other, other things of note and there's many things that are happening in Europe and once again these are just over view videos that are happening in 1943 is American forces early in 1943 are able to start doing bombing attacks on Germany itself and these bombing attacks only become more and more fierce as the war progresses another battle of note, In mid-1943 is the battle of kursk and this is really the last offensive that the axis powers are able to mount on the Eastern Front and they are defeated in this battle by the soviets and then once again that allows the Soviets to start going on the offensive so when you look at things from a European point of view the allies are definitely, they have the bulk over the momentum now they're now kind of putting the squeeze on the axis powers and frankly the same thing is happening in the Pacific especially the Americans, they are now on the offensive they're able to get closer and closer and closer to Japan
