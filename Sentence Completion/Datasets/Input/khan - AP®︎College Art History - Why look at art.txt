[MUSIC PLAYING] SPEAKER 1: I think
it's important that people look at art because
we live in a visual world. And understanding,
and looking at, and thinking about
the way images communicate in all kinds of
ways is important to being alive today. SPEAKER 2: If one has
heightened visual acumen, which you get from spending time
looking at things, whether it's looking at newspaper
photos closely, or looking at works in
a museum, or looking at your surroundings,
or birds more closely, that sort of attention
to an environment makes you a better person. You are existing in a more
aware, alert, present space. SPEAKER 3: Sometimes
people think that the only way
of looking at art is going to museums
and places like that. But maybe sometimes art is
everywhere, in the street, if you look at architectural
places, or everything. So you really don't need to
go to a museum to see art. It could be anywhere, in a
park, or looking at buildings, or going to a movie. So I think that's everyday life. SPEAKER 4: It's all
about noticing for me. It's all about trying to see
beyond the first impression. People look at art. And they'd say, I like this. I don't like this. And they move on. They have predetermined notions. But if you can just
stop and take a breath and look a little
deeper at something, you can really start to
notice some kind of detail that you might have
not noticed before. And I think that skill applies
to so many things in life aside from art,
about being able just to slow down and be aware of
actually where you're standing. And just even stop talking, and
just maybe open up your ears, for example. There's so much
detail around that you can absorb if you really
just take a moment, and just let it
come in, and listen. [MUSIC PLAYING]
