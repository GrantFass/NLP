- When John Lasseter
created his animated short, he wanted a younger lamp. He observed that children
tend to have bigger heads and bottoms as compared to
the rest of their bodies. So to make his lamp appear younger, he scaled down the lamp and then he he scaled up the foot and head to make Junior. To get a little experience
of creating a new model, let's add some scaling
deformers to modify the lamp. At Pixar, the art department
often gives us draw-overs to guide us in remodeling the character. In the following exercise, we
see a draw-over like this one that you will try to match
using scaling deformers. When you're done, your lamp
should look much younger.
