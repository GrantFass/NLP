Express 25 degrees
Celsius as a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit using
the formula Fahrenheit, or F, is equal to 9/5 times the
Celsius degrees plus 32. So they're telling us that
we have 25 degrees Celsius. So we could put
that in for C here, and we'll get the temperature
in Fahrenheit degrees. So let's do that. So we'll get F is equal
to 9/5-- now for C, we're going to put in
25-- times 25 plus 32. And now we can simplify this
before we multiply 25 times 9. Remember, this is the same
thing as 9/5 times 25/1. We can essentially divide the
numerator and the denominator of our eventual product by 5. If we divide 25 by 5, we get 5. If we divide 5 by 5, we get 1. So this boils down
to 9 times 5 plus 32. So our Fahrenheit
degrees are going to be 9 times 5 is
45 plus 32 degrees. Or it's equal to
45 plus 32 is 77, so this is 77
degrees Fahrenheit.
