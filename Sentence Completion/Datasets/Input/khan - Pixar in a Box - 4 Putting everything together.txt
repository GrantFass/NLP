- Great work! You've probably discovered
that changing the base scale changes the arm scale and head scale. This is because the
scales affect each other. When you're working with
controls like a scale deformer that affects a whole
model or a bunch of parts, it's best to get the overall scale right before the individual parts. We call this working from rough to fine. We now have all the concepts we need to model and rig our lamp. Go ahead and add scales to your lamp to make it appear younger and older, and rotate to all the joints
so you can pose the lamp, and a translate and a rotate to the base, so you can move the lamp around. And after the exercise,
we have a bonus step, which will allow you to try animating the fully-rigged lamp. You should definitely check
out the animation lesson before trying that one. (twinkling)
