These are the
tools I'd recommend you having for
building a Spout bot. First and foremost,
the safety glasses. Make sure you always
have safety glasses on and that you wear them
throughout the build process. They'll protect your
eyes from things that could go flying or
anything that might pop up. You want to have
a soldering iron. And you want to have a
soldering iron holder. Make sure whenever you're
not using the soldering iron, it's in the holder. And always remember to
unplug the soldering iron. It's going to allow
you to melt the solder and make connections,
electrical connections. This is our wire strippers. It's going to allow you to
strip a little bit of insulation off wires so you can
take the wire like this and just clean off
the insulation there. And that'll let you make a
nice electrical connection. Make sure your
wire strippers will strip wires that are 22 gauge. Then we've got our
needle nose pliers here. The needle nose pliers will
allow us to bend the wire and make a hook
with it like that. So we can connect it
to different things. We've also got
nipper pliers here. With the nipper pliers,
we can trim off the wire. And then with the duckbill
pliers here, we can bend it and we can also crimp it. So those are different
ways we can use the pliers. And then this is a
Phillips head screwdriver. We can use that for poking
a hole in our bottle caps. And of course, we've
got our hot glue gun. That's going to allow
us to melt the hot glue and connect different parts.
