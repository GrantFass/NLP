When configuring
any sensor, it's important to understand how to
poll them in real time, which means you grab their
current reading and see what it is right
inside the software. For example, I could
grab any sensor, but I have the
rotation sensor here. And now down in the
settings, when I click on it and I make sure I select the
correct port that the motor is plugged into, over on the left
is the live reading window, and for every sensor
you will have this. And in this case, it
says rotation sensor, and there's a little box,
which in real time as I move the motor, it updates with
the current reading, which is the number of
degrees of rotation. I position the
motor in some state, and I can click Reset,
which zeros the reading. And then I could rotate
my motor a certain amount, and then I can check
this window to see how many degrees it has rotated. And you can do this
for any sensor-- your current light reading,
sound reading, et cetera. And if you're not getting
a reading in real time and you've double checked
your port and connection, what I do is save everything,
close the software, and reopen it, and sometimes
that will fix the problem.
