- Everywhere you look, computers
are changing the world. Whether they're on our desktops,
in our homes, our pockets or just about anywhere else. - But while most of us use
this revolutionary technology daily, we don't often ask,
how do computers work? In this series, you're gonna learn how computers really work. Starting with what makes
a computer a computer. Then, you'll look at how
information is represented inside the computer using
tiny electrical signals going on and off at mind-boggling speeds. After that, you'll learn how
computers choose circuits to do everything from simple math to simulating entire virtual worlds. Next, you'll zoom out and look
at the different parts of the computer that actually input, output, and store all that information. Finally, you'll take a look
at what code actually is and how software controls hardware. So, whether you're just
curious about the devices you use everyday or you
wanna design the innovations of the future, the first step is learning how computers work. (upbeat music)
