20 teachers were asked
about their favorite course. 7 teachers said language. 3 teachers said history. 9 teachers said geometry. 1 teacher said chemistry. 0 teachers said physics. Create a bar chart showing
everyone's favorite courses. So we've got the bar
chart right over here. And let's see what
we need to plot. So it said, 0
teachers said physics, which is surprising
to me since physics is arguably my favorite course. But let's plot
what the data has. So physics-- so right now
it looks like it's halfway between 0 and 1, so
you actually have to bring the physics down to 0. Let's see, chemistry. Let's see, 1 teacher
said chemistry, so we got to bring
chemistry up to 1. Now, 9 teachers said geometry. So geometry, let's
bring that up to nine. 1 teacher said chemistry. Oh, I already read that. History. History. 3 teachers said history, so
let's bring history up to 3. And then language. 7 teachers said language,
so let's move this up to 7. And I think if I didn't
make any careless mistakes, we should be done. Yep. Very good.
