(air ship whines) - You probably noticed that
in order to get smooth motion, you ended up having to pose the ball in pretty much every frame. The computer's helping, but
it's still a lot of work to get something that looks smooth. Instead of linear interpolation, we can use something called Bézier curves. If you've ever used design
or drawing software, you've probably used Bézier
curves without even knowing it. This is named after a French
engineer, Pierre Bézier, who invented this method to describe the smooth curves needed
when designing cars. These kinds of functions made up of Bézier curves are called splines. I also mentioned them in the first video. Bézier curves come with
these handles that let us control the shape of the
graph between our key poses. We get this nice curve that
eases out of the first pose, and ramps down to the second one. If you look at how these values map, you can see something that looks
just like our timing chart. Now you try it out. You should be able to get much smoother motion using Bézier curves. (ball smacks rhythmically)
