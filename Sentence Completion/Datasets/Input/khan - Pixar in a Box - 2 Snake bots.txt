- In the rest of this
lesson, we're gonna look at a few other counting
problems that come up when you try to make a large crowd of robots from a small bin of parts. We're gonna be building up
to a really powerful formula that you can think of as a counting tool. (chimes ringing) To start, let's imagine snake-like robots. Let's call them Snake Bots. They are built as a sequence of segments where every segment must
be used exactly once. For instance, if I'm building
a three-segment Snake Bot, I might assemble the segments this way. Or I could do it this way. We'd again like to know: How many of these Snake Bots can I build? Remember, you have to account
for every possibility. In the next exercise,
you're gonna be asked to build all possible Snake
Bots of length one through four. Go get 'em!
