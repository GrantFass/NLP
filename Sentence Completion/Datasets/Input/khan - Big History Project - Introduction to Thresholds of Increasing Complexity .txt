NARRATOR:
Eight dramatic transitions drive Big History's
13.7 billion-year story. We call these major Thresholds
of Increasing Complexity. They are times
when the right ingredients combined with just
the right conditions to enable the creation
of an entirely new form of complexity. When our Universe appeared,
it was simple, and from our perspective,
frankly, a bit boring. There were no stars,
no planets, no life and certainly, no humans. And yet, look around,
and you'll see amazing complexity. A sky filled
with stars and galaxies in all stages of development. You'll see a solar system
formed by the remnants of stars that were born and died
billions of years ago. You'll see our own Earth filled
with mountains and rivers, deep caverns and vast oceans,
and incredible biodiversity. And you'll see
our own innovative species, with our computers,
airplanes and skyscrapers and our endless art
and invention. Eight thresholds explain
how a relatively simple Universe transformed into
the rich complexity that's all around us today. Each threshold builds upon
the previous one. Together they help explain
where everything came from. They help explain our own place
in the Universe and where things may be heading. Today, much of the Universe
is still pretty simple with large tracts
of empty space. We'll see how complex things
appeared in special regions, regions where the ingredients
and the Goldilocks conditions were just right to cross
new thresholds of complexity. Step by step, we'll see how new
forms of complexity appeared, each with components
and qualities that had never been seen before, leading to the world
we live in today.
