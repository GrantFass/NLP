SPEAKER 1: He can
spin in circles. SPEAKER 2: OK. Let's see what this one does. SPEAKER 3: That
makes [INAUDIBLE]. SPEAKER 2: He's making
really weird noises. SPEAKER 4: Hello! SPEAKER 1: Try and
take a picture. SPEAKER 2: No, stop! SPEAKER 3: It's made
out of a bunch of things that you'd have around
the house, like an alarm clock, a hair dryer,
a coffee machine. A lot of things that
have everyday uses. SPEAKER 1: A microphone, the
silver band from a coffeemaker. SPEAKER 2: They had
bottlecaps, and then other pieces of the bottle. And they had some parts
from a hair dryer, and it also has a speaker
from an alarm clock. SPEAKER 4: On the
count of three. SPEAKER 1: No, let me do it. Let me do it. SPEAKER 3: All three of us. SPEAKER 2: One, two, three. ALL: Me! SPEAKER 5: Hello there! SPEAKER 2: OK, ready? BIT-ZEE: Me! SPEAKER 5: Wait, can
I have the remote. SPEAKER 1: No, I want
to say, [INAUDIBLE]. SPEAKER 2: It has a lot of cool
science and math stuff in it, which I don't know yet,
because I haven't learned. Whoa! SPEAKER 5: I think
that's from the band. Is that from the band? My favorite thing about Bit-Zee
bot is probably all of it.
