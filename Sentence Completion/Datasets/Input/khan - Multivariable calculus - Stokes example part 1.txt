Let's now attempt to apply Stokes' theorem And so over here we have this little diagram, and we have this path that we're calling C, and it's the intersection of the plain Y+Z=2, so that's the plain that kind of slants down like that, its the intersection of that plain and the cylinder, you know I shouldn't even call it a cylinder because if you just have x^2 plus y^2 is equal to one, it would essentially be like a pole, an infinite pole that keeps going up forever and keeps going down forever so it would never have a top or a bottom but we slice that pole, with y plus z is equal to 2, to get where they intersect we get our path C. We also have this vector field defined in this way
