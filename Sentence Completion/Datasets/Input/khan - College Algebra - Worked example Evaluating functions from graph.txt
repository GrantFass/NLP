The function f of x is graphed. Find f of negative 1. So this graph right
over here is essentially a definition of our function. It tells us, given the allowed
inputs into our function, what would the function output? So here, they're
saying, look, what gets output when we input
x is equal to negative 1? So x equals negative 1
is right over here. x is equal to negative 1. And our function
graph is right at 6 when f is equal to negative 1. So we can say that f of
negative 1 is equal to 6. Let me write that over here.
f of negative 1 is equal to 6.
