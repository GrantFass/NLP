Just realized that I
typed in the wrong numbers at the end of the
last video when I was trying to put
them in the calculator. We were trying to determine the
coefficient of static friction, and it's 50 newtons divided by
49 square roots of 3 newtons. And in the last video, by
accident, in the calculator, instead of doing 49
square roots of 3, I wrote 40 square roots of 3. So let's actually
calculate it again. 50 divided by 49 times--
let me write it this way, make sure we get-- 49
times the square root of 3 gives us a coefficient of static
friction of, if we round it, 0.59. So this is equal to 0.59. And so that's it. I just forgot to-- I
did the calculation wrong on the calculator
in the last video.
