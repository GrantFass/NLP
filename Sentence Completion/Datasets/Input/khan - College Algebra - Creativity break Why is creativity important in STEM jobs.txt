(soft upbeat music) - I think my idea of how
creativity works in STEM jobs has changed since I've gone to college. I used to think that
all the mathematicians would be locked away in some office and typing on the computers or writing down equations by themselves and coming up with
incredibly beautiful ideas just by themselves. But I'm realizing now that I'm in college that mathematics and creativity, it's a lot about communication, and it's a lot about trying to build off of each other's ideas and bounce ideas off of each other and build upon ideas that
have already been made by people decades ago. And I think that the facts
that we all come with it, with our own perspectives, and different ideas and
different ways of being creative allows math to advance further, because we can all
combine our creative ideas into something bigger. - We collect data on everything, right? And so the ability to use that data in a smart, safe, and efficient way depends on new applications
of mathematical concepts to these new and innovative data sets. As we get to that point, we'll start to be thinking
outside the box a lot more, and we'll be a much more
innovative, digital society, but that can't happen unless
we start trying to be creative, and not just rely on tried and true. (soft upbeat music)
