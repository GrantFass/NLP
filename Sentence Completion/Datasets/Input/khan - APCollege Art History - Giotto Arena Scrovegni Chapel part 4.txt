(light piano music) - [Steven] Below the "Passion"
scene is even more painting. There are these marvelous representations of virtues and vices. That is, expressions of good and evil. - [Beth] And we have
virtues and vices here because these are the good and evil that we confront, all of us, in our lives. And these are the things that decide, at the Day of Judgment,
we go to Heaven or Hell. - [Steven] And so, they are
abstractions of the ideas that are told in the stories above. - [Beth] We're looking
at the figure of Envy. - [Steven] It's one of
my favorite figures. - [Beth] Here's a figure in profile, engulfed in flames, clutching a bag. - [Steven] But reaching
with her other hand for something she does not
have, something that she wants. - [Beth] Not content with
what she has, she wants more. - [Steven] She's got huge ears. It's as if every sense is attuned
to what she does not have. - [Beth] We see emerging from her mouth a snake who moves toward her eyes. - [Steven] That's right. It doubles back on itself, because it is what she sees
that bites her, in a sense. The final virtue, as we
move towards the exit of the chapel is Hope. She is reaching upward,
floating, a classicized figure. - [Beth] And she's winged like an angel and is lifted up toward a
figure on the upper right who's handing her a crown. - [Steven] And so Hope,
because she's in the corner, is looking up towards "The Last Judgment" and is of the same scale, and her body is in the
same diagonal position as the elect in the bottom left corner. The elect are the blessed. That is, these are people
that are going to Heaven. And if you look carefully, you can see that their feet are not on the ground. They're actually levitating
slightly, they're rising up. - [Beth] Many of them with their hands in positions of prayer, looking up toward the
enormous figure of Christ, the largest figure in this chapel. - [Steven] And you'll see that they're actually
accompanied by angels. It looks so caring and gentle. They're shepherding
these people into Heaven. - [Beth] This benevolent,
generous expressions on the face of those angels as they look at all of these individuals who've made the choices in their lives that have led them to this
moment of being blessed. - [Steven] The choices
that are laid out for us in the virtues and vices
in the bottom panels. Just below the elect, you can see that there are what seem
to be children, naked, coming out of coffins, out of tombs. And those nude figures
are meant to represent the souls that are to be judged by Christ, who, as you said, sits in the middle. He sits here to judge those souls that are being awakened
from the dead to determine whether or not they're blessed
and get to go to Heaven or if they're gonna end up on the right side of
this painting, in Hell. - [Beth] And so this follows
very standard iconography or standard composition
of the Last Judgment. Just to either side of Christ, though, that division of left
and right doesn't happen. - [Steven] That's because this is Heaven. - [Beth] And there we
see a Cord of Saints, and around that mandorla, that
full-body halo around Christ, we see angels blowing trumpets. - [Steven] We have the angels
announcing the end of time. We have angels above them rolling up the sky as if it were a scroll. And these are images that we generally see in Last Judgements because they are in the text of the Bible. - [Beth] The Book of Revelation. The scene of Hell on the lower right with a large blue figure that
is meant to represent Satan. Surrounding him are souls
being tortured in Hell. - [Steven] "The Divine Comedy,"
which was extremely popular, describes the landscape of Hell. - [Beth] And equates
the punishments of Hell with the different kinds of
sins that people committed. And so, in "The Last Judgment"
that we're looking at, and because the patron here was concerned with the sin of usury,
we see usurers featured, and they're being hung
with the bags of money on the ropes that they're hanging from. - [Steven] Right. Usury is requiring interest
for when you lend money. It's basically just the act of banking. Just think about it with the way a credit card works, for instance. And that was a mortal
sin according to Christ. In fact, Dante speaks at
great length about the usurers who have their money bags
hanging from their necks and are in one of the
lowest circles of Hell. Below the usurers, you
can actually make out a specific individual, also hanged. This is Judas, the disciple
that betrays Christ. - [Beth] So anyone leaving
the chapel from this exit would look up at the
scene of "Last Judgment," up at the cross carried by two angels. Perhaps they would notice that figure that I just noticed, a
figure behind the cross sort of grasping it for dear life, and would also have looked up and have seen Enrico Scrovegni himself, the patron offering this
chapel to the three Marys. - [Steven] As the public
would have walked outside after a sermon, after mass perhaps, they would be reminded
right before they walk back into the world, the world
of desire, the world of sin, that the sacrifice that Christ had made, that story that had unfolded
in this chapel comes down to decisions that they need
to make in their own life. This is, in a sense, a last
reminder before you walk out to take these stories seriously. - [Beth] And Giotto makes it
very easy for us to do that by painting these figures
in their humanity, by making the narrative
so easy and clear to read and by making something so beautiful. Recognized for its beauty- - [Steven] Even in its own day. (light piano music)
