(upbeat music) (logos pop) (screen whooshes) (keyboard clicks) - I think it's really exciting how biology and creativity have combined, particularly in the area
of health and outcomes. And how do we help people with blindness? How do we help people who are paraplegic, where we can start to read
the electrical activity of their intended movement
and have a robot do that. So they can gain, you know, that activity again, and have that power in their lives again. I think that is a classic and beautiful example of the combination of biology and creativity
making our lives better every single day - Butterflies use something
called structural color which involves bending light
to generate color instead of using a bunch of pigment. So it definitely saves the butterflies a bunch of energy in making that pigment. But now because of some observant
and innovative scientists it's saving us energy too. It's being used in screens around the world to
make them more efficient at projecting color, which
reduces the carbon footprint as some of our most common electronics. And how about the creativity of using mRNA which is pretty much just
biological text messages to give our bodies a heads up that they need to recognize
dangerous viruses. It's the technology being used in some of our most innovative vaccines right now. (screen whooshes) (upbeat music)
