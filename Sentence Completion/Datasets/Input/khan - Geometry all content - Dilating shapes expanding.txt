The graph below contains
the rectangle ABCP. Draw the image of ABCP under a
dilation whose center is at P and a scale factor is 1 and 2/3. What are the lengths of
the side AB and its image? So we're going to do a
dilation centered at P. So if we're centering
a dilation at P and its scale
factor is 1 and 2/3, that means once we
perform the dilation, every point is going to be 1 and
2/3 times as far away from P. Well P is 0 away from
P, so its image is still going to be at P. So let's put
that point right over there. Now point C is going
to be 1 and 2/3 times as far as it is right now. So let's see, right
now it is 6 away. It's at negative 3. And P, its x-coordinate is the
same, but in the y direction, P is at 3. C is at negative 3. So it's 6 less. We want to be 1 and
2/3 times as far away. So what's 1 and 2/3 of 6? Well, 2/3 of 6 is 4, so
it's going to be 6 plus 4. You're going to be 10 away. So 3 minus 10, that
gets us to negative 7. So that gets us
right over there. Now point A, right
now it is 3 more in the horizontal direction
than point P's x-coordinate. So we want to go
1 and 2/3 as far. So what is 1 and 2/3 times 3? Well that's going to be 3 plus
2/3 of 3, which is another 2. So that's going to be 5. So we're going to
get right over there. Then we could complete
the rectangle. And notice point B is
now 1 and 2/3 times as far in the
horizontal direction. It was 3 away in the
horizontal direction, now it is 5 away from
P's x-coordinate. And in the vertical
direction, in the y direction, it was 6 below P's y-coordinate. Now it is 1 and
2/3 times as far. It is 10 below P's y-coordinate. So then let's answer
these questions. The length of segment AB--
well, we already saw that. That is, we're going
from 3 to negative 3. That is 6 units long. And its image, well
it's 1 and 2/3 as long. We see it over here. We're going from
3 to negative 7. 3 minus negative 7 is 10. It is 10 units long. We got it right.
