(gentle music) - I've used creative communication
to solve problems related to especially people
learning different science. For example, in chemistry people
sometimes have a hard time understanding subatomic particles and molecules and atoms and
making those connections between quantities and numbers. So instead of jumping right into that which can be very difficult for people, I've learned to be
creative and use analogies or relating that to something
that is more accessible such as cooking or money
or building something. And then when people can make the relation between something large and familiar, to something small or
subatomic and unfamiliar it makes it easier for them
to make those connections and build upon that knowledge. So several years ago I started
making videos of myself explaining biology and
entomology in language that was accessible and
familiar to people my age and people who don't fit
the stereotypical model of a scientist. It's a choice that I'm really
glad that I made actually. I've received so much
positive feedback about videos no more complicated than me holding a bug in front of a camera. And actually just like this, me literally holding a
bug in front of a camera and explaining what makes a tick. Note to self, I should make a video about
what makes ticks tick. That'd be pretty cool. Wait, sorry, that's
neither here nor there. The point of what I'm saying is the choice not to excise my personality, the choice to bring all of my quirkiness into how I communicate is what
seems to make the difference. A big part of being creative
really can be just figuring out how to bring all of you to whatever it is that you choose to do. (gentle music)
