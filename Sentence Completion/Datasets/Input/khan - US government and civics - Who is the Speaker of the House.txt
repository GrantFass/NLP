- [Narrator] Who is the
Speaker of the House and what do they do? - The office of the Speaker of the House is actually outlined in the Constitution. That's one of the things that makes the Speaker of the House unique. The Speaker of the House
does not have to be a member of the House
although there has never been a Speaker who has not been
a member of the House. And traditionally the Speaker of the House is the member picked
by the majority party. Doesn't have to be from the majority party but that's always the way it's worked out and essentially everybody
in the House gets together and whoever gets the most
votes of the people voting. It's just the people voting, not necessarily the entire House. Whoever gets the most votes becomes the Speaker of the House.
