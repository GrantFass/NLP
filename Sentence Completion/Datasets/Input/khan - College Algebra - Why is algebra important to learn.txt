(marker scratching) (gentle upbeat music) - Algebra is really the unifying thread of almost all of mathematics. You may think algebra is boring, but it is the one tool you can
use to not only understand, but unlock the universe. Creative algebra is used
in computer game design. It powers how artificial
intelligence works. Mastering algebra will
provide you with the ability to decode and understand
many complex systems. In my opinion, if you can master algebra, you can master anything.
