These are the parts
you're going to need to build your Spout bot. We've got lead free solder here. This is going to be used
to make metal connections and conduct electricity and
hold our circuit together. We've got some hot glue. That's a hot glue stick. We'll use that to hold
the parts together that don't need to
conduct electricity. We have two resistors here. These are 41 ohm resistors. You can use anywhere from
around 40 to 200 ohms. It kind of depends on how
bright you want your LEDs to be and what types of
LEDs you choose. We've got our LEDs here. These are two water clear blue
LEDs and four paper clips. There are two 1.5 volts to three
volt motors, which work well with our batteries, which
happen to be 1.5 volt double As. And together in series,
they are three volts. Then we have two bottle
caps from water bottles, some shrink wrap tubing. This comes in a lot of
different sizes and colors. We've chosen 1/16 inch and
I believe 1/8 inch tubing. And we've got some sliding
lever switches here. I should say, sliding switches. These are sliding single
pole double throw switches. We've bent one of the
throws out of the way so it's just a single
pole single throw switch. So we're going to use
those as on/off switches. And then we have single pole
double throw lever switches. And we're going to
use one pole in both of the throws for those. And then we have wire. And this is 22 gauge
insulated wire. We've chosen a number
of different colors-- green, blue, red,
yellow, and white. And basically, we
chose those colors because they're going to
show up better in the video when we put them on top
of our battery holder. And this is our double
A battery holder. So those are the
parts that you're going to need to
build the Spout bot. Now we're going to
talk about the tools.
