By the time you get to the 1940s&nbsp;
in your study of world history, you will have encountered a lot of revolutions.&nbsp;
Some of these were mainly liberal revolutions meant to establish political rights for a middle&nbsp;
class under the republic as a form of government. The American War of Independence is a&nbsp;
good example of this type of revolution. You have also seen social revolutions. They're&nbsp;
still about liberation, but these revolutionaries took an even deeper dive and sought to overturn&nbsp;
the existing class systems and economic structures that oppress them. An early example is the Haitian&nbsp;
Revolution. Many revolutions fell somewhere in between, with some political and some social&nbsp;
and economic change. By the early 20th century, transformations like the Mexican Revolution&nbsp;
usually split the revolutionaries into two groups, some who just wanted political rights for a middle&nbsp;
class of people and others, usually socialists or communists, who are fighting for better lives and&nbsp;
livelihoods for poor workers and peasants. Hello, I'm Francesca Hodges, and today we are going to&nbsp;
look at another revolution that saw this split between political liberals and communists and&nbsp;
which ended up fundamentally transforming not just one country but the entire world, the&nbsp;
Chinese Communist Revolution of 1945-1949. China, at the beginning of the 20th century, 
had been racked by civil war, invaded by outside powers, and had almost&nbsp;
collapsed under the weight of the Boxer Rebellion. During this period, nobody suffered&nbsp;
more from this chaos than the Chinese peasants, many of whom experienced famine, theft,&nbsp;
and exploitation on an enormous scale. In October 1911, revolutionaries in&nbsp;
the central Chinese city of Wuchang rebelled against the authorities. Their rebellion&nbsp;
spread, and in 1912 the Chinese Republic was born. This group of revolutionaries were mainly&nbsp;
army officers and members of the middle class, and their revolution really only aimed to&nbsp;
change the political structure of China not to transform the poverty of the peasants, and&nbsp;
it wasn't even a successful political revolution. By 1916, China had broken apart into many regions&nbsp;
ruled by local warlords, while the central government had only limited authority. Meanwhile,&nbsp;
outside powers still tried to take bites of this vast country. The worst was Japan, which expanded&nbsp;
its territory in China in the 1920s and 1930s. So now, there were two groups trying to reunite&nbsp;
China and push back against the Japanese invasion. The first was a group of Chinese nationalists&nbsp;
who formed a party known as the Guomindang. The Guomindang fought to strengthen the democratic&nbsp;
republic, but they didn't want economic change. In 1925, a leader named Chiang Kai-shek&nbsp;
took control of this party and became the official leader of the Republic of China. The&nbsp;
second group was the Chinese Communist Party. They didn't just want political change. They&nbsp;
wanted a social and economic revolution to help peasants escape from poverty. This party had many&nbsp;
leaders, but the one we will get to know best is Mao Zedong.  At times, the Guomindang nationalists&nbsp;
and the Chinese Communist Party work together. Both fought against the Japanese for example&nbsp;
before and during the Second World War. At the end of that war in 1945, Japan was&nbsp;
defeated by the Allied Forces, including China alongside the United States, Britain, France, and&nbsp;
the Soviet Union. The Japanese invasion was over, but China still had two competing factions,&nbsp;
the Guomindang government under Chiang Kai-shek and the Communist Party led by Mao Zedong. These&nbsp;
two forces now turned on each other in what we know as the Chinese Communist Revolution. It's&nbsp;
a lot of plot twists, right. And with the start of the Chinese Communist Revolution, it can&nbsp;
be even harder to follow, both in terms of the history of China and as part of a history&nbsp;
of global revolutions. That's why I decided I needed the help of an expert, so I reached out&nbsp;
to Professor Prasenjit Duara at Duke University. So starting off with our first question then.&nbsp;
What was the Chinese Communist Revolution? The Chinese Communist Revolution was&nbsp;
essentially a massive assault to massively overhaul Chinese society as a first step&nbsp;
in their ideology, in the ideology of the communists to overhaul global society&nbsp;
so that there would be social justice and that the people at the bottom of the rung in&nbsp;
peasant societies, in urban societies in China would have a greater share both in the economic&nbsp;
and political dimensions of life and have a better life in general. So why did the Chinese Communist&nbsp;
Revolution happen? It happened because firstly China has had a long tradition of peasant&nbsp;
rebellions. This is one that has happened before the Christian era. You've had enormous&nbsp;
Chinese peasant rebellions where they rose up, and the Chinese communists themselves believe&nbsp;
that they drew on this tradition, but of course they gave it a modern twist. They gave it a modern&nbsp;
ideology to look for more modern institutions and ideas of equality and justice and the&nbsp;
removal of exploiters of these people, and so they drew on that and for that of course&nbsp;
they drew upon what were globally circulating ideas of a revolution that came from the&nbsp;
Soviet Revolution and other areas of the world. Speaking to the revolution itself, why&nbsp;
did the communists win? The Japanese occupation helped the Chinese Communist Party to a great&nbsp;extent because the Guomindang, while it was also opposed to Japanese occupation, was not able to&nbsp;persuade or convince the people to support them against the Japanese because they were not able&nbsp;
to penetrate into society and show that they could bring about a better society than either&nbsp;
was there before or under Japanese occupation. Whereas, the Chinese communists had the mobilizing&nbsp;
power. They had the organization to be able to penetrate deep into rural society and even&nbsp;
appeal to the nationalism of the people against the Japanese occupiers who were very&nbsp;
violent in many cases in China, in occupied China, and they also engaged in various kinds of reforms&nbsp;
like giving land and giving dignity to the poor, the rural poor in particular. In 1949, the Chinese&nbsp;
communists were able to seize power from the Guomindang who fled to the island of Taiwan. Mao&nbsp;
Zedong ruled a unified communist state, the People's Republic of China on the mainland.&nbsp;
Not only was China an independent country, it now had a role to play in two episodes&nbsp;
of global significance, in the post-war era, decolonization and the Cold War. I wanted&nbsp;
to ask Professor Duara more about this role. What role did the People's Republic of China play&nbsp;
in decolonization after the revolution? China did provide support for socialist, anti-colonial&nbsp;
movements, and it provided material support in terms of arms, in terms of expert advice, in terms&nbsp;
of money to anti-colonial, socialist movements, and one of the best examples of that is perhaps&nbsp;
Vietnam where it turned out, by the end of the Vietnam War, to have been the greatest supporter.&nbsp;
Can we then see the Chinese Communist Revolution as part of the Cold War struggle? Yes, I think&nbsp;
we can if we also recognize that the Chinese Communist Revolution generally supported&nbsp;
decolonization movements but actively supported decolonization movements that&nbsp;
were socialistically oriented. I ended my conversation with Dr. Duara by asking about&nbsp;
the successes and failures of the revolution. What did the revolution achieve? The Chinese&nbsp;Communist Revolution I think achieved a great deal. Once it was able to get through to the&nbsp;rural populace and implement their policies, they were able to achieve what we now consider human&nbsp;development indicators so that they were able to improve the health of the people by bringing&nbsp;sort of basic health services, by providing&nbsp;&nbsp; basic education to vast numbers of illiterate&nbsp;
people. They were able to create job skills, and they also created ideas of equality. So women&nbsp;
for instance were given very important roles in society that they did not have before,&nbsp;
and this gave also a tremendous amount, and they were able to give some property to the&nbsp;
poor who did not have, so this was also able to give some kind of measure of self-respect to&nbsp;
people in society, to the lower classes of society. To counter that question then, what were some of&nbsp;
the failures of the revolution? Well, I think that the principal failure is the cost of revolution, the cost of revolution in terms of human lives, which you know over a million people were probably&nbsp;
killed during the land reforms which took away land from a lot of people and also killed a lot&nbsp;
of people who were considered traitors or who had other religious beliefs and so on. Within the&nbsp;
long history of revolutions in the modern age, few were as transformative as the Chinese&nbsp;
Revolution. Building on a tradition of peasant uprisings within China and inspired&nbsp;
by revolutions elsewhere, the Chinese Communist Party took power and overturned&nbsp;
the lives of the wealthy and the poor alike. Seventy years later, the Communist Party still&nbsp;
governs China. In another video, we will explore its policies and their effects on the Chinese&nbsp;
people in the era of intense globalization.
