Consider the following
coordinate pairs. And they give us a
bunch right over here. Which of those pairs
is not graphed below? So let's see, 3
comma negative 2. So 3 comma negative 2,
well, actually, that looks like that first
one is not graphed. So 3 comma negative
2 isn't graphed. And you can verify that
all of these others do seem to be graphed. 4 comma negative
8 is right there. Negative 8 comma 3
is right over here. 4 comma 6 is right there. And negative 1 comma
0 is right there. So let's do a couple
more of these. So is negative 5
comma 0 graphed? Yep. It's right over there. Negative 4 comma positive
5 should be there. So that's not graphed. So let me just select that one. Let's do one more of these. Negative 8 comma 4, so negative
8 comma 4, we got lucky. The first one is not
graphed-- negative 8 comma 4. And we're done.
