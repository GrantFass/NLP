- [Instructor] Alright,
so here's our motor and then we talked about all
of the different components in the motor and how they work, so I'm gonna try and talk about the motor that we made here and
show you how it's similar to the motor that we have here, so these are our permanent magnets, so they are just like, they're
behaving just like this guy, which is the permanent magnet
in our hair dryer motor and they're both opposing
poles, so this is north pole and this is the south pole magnet and so, if you put them
next to each other, the way they're set up, they
would wanna snap together 'cause the opposites attract, but those opposite poles are important, so that as the armature,
which is this guy, represented by this coil here. As that flips around,
it continues to move. Now, the commutator here is
actually rather hard to see, but it is the copper wire
here that's been stripped, so we strip away the
insulation on the copper wire on this side, but we left it on this side. Now, the insulation is
actually a clear lacquer, so it's hard to see, but
we did strip that away with a knife and so that
means that that section of the copper wire is functioning just like our commutator
here in our electric motor and the brushes, which
conducts the electricity from the contact here into the commutator, well, our washers are functioning
just like the brushes, so they're conducting the
electricity from our battery down to our commutator or wire and that's conducting the power through the coil or the armature and then back out the other side and back to the battery
and completing the circuit and so what's that doing is that it's creating an electromagnet that is resisting the
permanent magnets that are here and causing this device to
spin around and turn our fan just like this guy turns
our hair dryer motor fan, so let's take a look at how that works. In our hair dryer motor, we have a switch. When we turn it on,
the fan starts spinning and on this one, same thing happens, so you can see the motors spinning there and then we turn the switch
off and it'll stop spinning.
