- I have been working on
the US history content here for more than two years now. And we have a team of experts who've been in the classroom for many years, who have advanced degrees in US history, who really rigorously write, tape, and edit each other's work. And I think it would be kind of, I would judge it as like
a day's worth of class. Everything that we've done
on the Khan Academy website meets the AP requirements. So teachers can feel confident that when they send their students to watch a video or read an article or practice with an
exercise on Khan Academy, that students are taking away
the key learning objectives that they should get for the AP exam. - [Instructor] It's a frequent
misconception that people in this time period thought
that the world was flat. - We really wanted to make this material approachable and fun. And so throughout, I
think, students will see a real enthusiasm for the
material and a sense of humor, so that it's not just
reading a history textbook. - [Instructor] So I've brought you here to talk about the Gilded Age, which is one of my favorite
eras of American history. - [Man] Because everything
was great and covered in gold? - It's really interacting with some of the big questions of history, and having an opportunity to
explore those with enthusiasm. - [Instructor] No,
because it is the only era of American history I can think of that has a sarcastic name. (man laughs) - Because it is fun. We hope to give students that sense that history is not a boring subject. It's really fun.
