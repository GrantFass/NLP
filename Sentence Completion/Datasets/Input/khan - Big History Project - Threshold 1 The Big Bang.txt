NARRATOR:
Our first threshold is the Big Bang, which happened
about 13.7 billion years ago and led to the creation
of the entire Universe. We don't know much
about the ingredients and the Goldilocks conditions that led to this
first threshold because we just
don't have much evidence. For example, what made
the Big Bang possible? We don't know. Why did the Big Bang happen? We can only speculate. Was there even space and time
before the Big Bang? We don't know that either. What we do know is that
the Big Bang provided the raw materials
for everything around us today. After the Big Bang
there was space, which was rapidly expanding,
and there was time. There was also
matter and energy. At first,
the Universe was so hot that you couldn't tell
the difference between matter and energy, but within the first billionth
of a second after the Big Bang, matter and energy separated. Then energy took
different forms, including gravity
and electromagnetism. And matter appeared in the form
of electrons and quarks. And quarks soon linked up
to form protons and neutrons. Why is this so important? Because nothing had turned
into something, and that something
contained everything needed to build
an interesting Universe, one that could
eventually include you and me. Now let's take a closer look
at how our Universe began to build
more complex things.
