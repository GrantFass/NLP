Jade working in China dates&nbsp;back more than 6,000 years The Chinese term for jade is "yu". This term&nbsp;refers to a variety of hard stones that are either transparent or semi-transparent. The&nbsp;two main stones are nephrite, found in many parts of the world, and jadeite. In China, the best&nbsp;nephrite is found in the river beds near Hetian in Xinjiang Province. Jadeite was imported&nbsp;from Burma beginning around the 1700s. Jade is too hard to be carved. In the past, artisans&nbsp;shaped jade by abrading it with various tools worked with sand and water. The working of jade&nbsp;can be seen as a three-step process: 1. Cutting the overall shape. 2. Abrading the details. 3. And&nbsp;polishing the surface. This is Yun Sang Leung, a jade artist who lives in Niagara Falls, Canada. Mr. Leung apprenticed in Hong Kong and worked jade there for many years. He demonstrates the&nbsp;old method of using a bow and abrasives to saw a talisman. Today, artisans use power tools such&nbsp;as a dentist's drill. The bits are covered with ground diamonds. Mr. Leung is demonstrating&nbsp;jade working using modern methods. He makes, however, an ancient shape. The cicada, modeled on&nbsp;one in the [Asian Art] Museum collection about 2,000 years old, is associated with the concept of rebirth. Cicadas live underground for years. In the final stage of their life, they emerge above ground. In&nbsp;Ancient China, a cicada like this would have been placed on the tongue of a deceased person as a&nbsp;way of preserving the vital energy in the body. According to an old Chinese saying, "Gold&nbsp;is valuable, but jade is invaluable." The Book of Rites, compiled about 2300 years ago,&nbsp;states: "If a ruler observes the rites of the state, white jade will appear in the valley." Confucius noted that "the wise have likened jade to virtue." Jade is still highly&nbsp;valued by the Chinese people. Artisans produce both traditional and contemporary&nbsp;forms, employing modern technologies. Jade work is surely one of the&nbsp;world's oldest artistic traditions.
