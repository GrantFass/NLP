(upbeat music) - We have the opportunity to
work together with a variety of different voices, colleagues
from all over the world who have different
strengths that they bring, different perspectives that they bring, about life, and about
how the world operates, and only when we bring
those voices together will we have a more complete picture about how the living world works. So in order to really solve
the problems of the future, we're going to need to work together as a global community. - Problems are not solved in isolation. They're solved in collaborative
groups with other people, and they're solved to be realistic. So you have to consider not
just your own discipline or your own science, but also
some economics, and ethics, and other things that
relate to the real world to help you reach a real
world, but sensible, solution. So it requires combining
all those different ways of thinking, being communicative
and problem solving and working with other people so that you can reach solutions that actually benefit the world, because some solutions are
gonna be great on paper, but in practice, they
aren't really practical. So that's why using new ways of thinking to solve
problems is really important. - As an example, for
me, in my PhD project, even though my background
has been in biology, the problem that really
captured my interest and that I wanted to pursue
involves mechanics and physics. And so it required learning a lot of some deep theories and ideas in physics that I wouldn't have thought of before, and now I kinda approach, it sort of changed the way that I approach biological problems. Now I have this physics lens
that I didn't have before, and that expands the possibilities of experiments I can think of, or hypotheses that I could
have for how something works. (upbeat music)
