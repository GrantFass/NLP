(upbeat music) - In order to get more creative, I would encourage young people to be not afraid of making mistakes. It's okay to fail while
exploring a new trail of thought. Know that usually there
is more than one solution to the problem. Math is as much about posing
problems as problem solving. And at that point, creativity is noticing where there is something
worthwhile investigating. - As a student in math, I think it's important to remember that math isn't just like
random symbols on paper. Like math can mean something and it's pretty powerful
that you as a student can build something that uses math. Creativity in math isn't just about being able to pluck numbers from the air and like, oh yes, I know the solution. It's about being able to use problems that help with your daily life.
