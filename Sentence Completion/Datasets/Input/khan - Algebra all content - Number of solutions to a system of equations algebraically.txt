how many solutions does the following 
system of linear equations have and I   have my system right over here there's 
a couple of ways to think about it one   way is to think about them graphically 
and think about well are they the same   line in which case they would have 
an infinite number of solutions are   they parallel in which case they never 
intersect you'd have no solutions or do   they intersect exactly one place in case 
you would have one solution but instead   we're going to do this algebraically 
so let's try to actually just solve   the system and see what we get so the 
first equation I'm going to leave that   unchanged 5x minus 9y is equal to 
is equal to is 16 now this second   equation right over here let's say I 
want to cancel out the X terms so let me   multiply the second equation by negative 
one so I have a negative 5x that I can   cancel out with the 5x so if I multiply 
the second equation by negative one I'm   going to have negative 5x plus 9y plus 
9 Y is equal to negative 36 negative 36   now what I'm going to do is I'm going 
to add the left side of the equations   and the right sides of the equations to 
get a new equation so 5x minus 5x well   that's going to be 0 negative 9y plus 9y 
well that's going to be 0 again I don't   even have to write it it's just going 
to be 0 on the left-hand side and on   the right-hand side I'm going to have 
16 minus 36 so negative 20 so now I'm   left with the somewhat bizarre-looking 
equation that says that 0 is equal to   negative 20 now one way you might say 
well how does this make any sense and   the way to think about it is well are 
there any X Y values 4 which is 0 is   going to be equal to negative 20 well no 
0 is never going to be equal to negative   20 and so it doesn't matter what X Y 
values you can never find an X well X or   XY pair that's going to make 0 equal to 
negative 20 in fact the X's and Y's have   disappeared from this equation there's 
no way that this is going to be true so   we have no we have no solutions now if 
you were to plot these if you were to   plot each of these lines you would see 
that they are parallel lines and that's   why they have the same slope different 
y-intercepts and that's why we have no   solutions they don't intersect let's do 
another one of these this is this is fun   all right how many solutions does the 
following system of linear equations   have so let's do the same thing I'm 
going to keep the first equation the   same negative 6x plus 4y is equal to 2 
and the second equation let me just see   if I can cancel out the X term so if I 
have a negative 6x if I multiply this by   2 I'm going to have a positive 6x so I 
can let's see I'm going to multiply this   whole equation both sides of it by 2 so 
I'm going to have 6x 3 x times 2 is 6x   negative 2y times 2 is negative 4y and 
that is going to be equal to negative   2 now let's do the same thing let's 
add the left sides and let's add the   right sides so negative 6x plus 6x well 
that's going to be 0 4y minus 4y that's   0 we just have a 0 on the left-hand 
side now on the right-hand side we   have 2 plus negative 2 well that's 0 so 
this is a little bit different it still   looks a little bit bizarre 0 equals 
0 last time we had 0 is equal to we   add what 0 is equal to negative 20 now 
we have 0 equals 0 so one way to think   about it is even though the X's and 
Y's are no longer in this equation   okay well what XY pairs is it going to 
be true for is that it's going to make   it true that 0 is equal to 0 well this 
is going to be true no matter what x and   y are in fact x and y are not involved 
in this equation anymore 0 is always   going to be equal to 0 so this is going 
to have an infinitely this is going to   have infinitely many solutions here and 
that's because these are the same lines   they just look a little bit different 
algebraically but if you scale one of   them in the right way in fact if you 
just multiply both sides of this one   the second one by negative 2 you're 
going to get the top one and so they   actually represent the exact same 
lines you have an infinitely many   solutions all right when trying to 
find the solution to the following   system of linear equations Yvonne takes 
several correct steps that lead to the   equation negative 5 is equal to 20 how 
many solutions is the system of linear   equations have I don't even have to 
look at the system right over here   the fact that she got the statement 
that can never be true negative 5 is   never going to be equal to 20 tells 
us that she has no those solutions   and once again if you were to plot 
these graphically you would see that   these are parallel lines that's why they 
have no solutions they never intersect   there's no XY pair that satisfies both 
of these constraints let's do a let's   do a couple more of these when trying 
to find the solution to the following   system of linear equations Alba's take 
several correct steps that lead to the   equation 5y is equal to negative 5 and 
say how many solutions does this system   of linear equations have well 5y equals 
negative 5 we could divide both sides   by 5 and we get Y is equal to negative 
1 and then if you substitute back in Y   is equal to negative 1 if you did it 
in this first equation if Y is equal   to negative 1 all of this becomes 
positive 2 you can subtract 2 from   both sides and you get 5x is equal to 
4 or you'd get what X is equal to 4/5   or if you put negative 1 over here you 
would get 5x minus 3 is equal to 1 you   could add 3 to both sides and you get 
5x equals 4 again X is equal to 4/5 so   you have exactly one solution you 
would have X is equal to 4/5 y is   equal to negative 1 let's do one more 
when trying to find the solution of the   following system of linear equations 
Levon take several correct steps that   lead to the equation 0 equals 0 so once 
again I don't even need to look at this   over here zero equals zero is always 
going to be true so this is going to   have an infinitely this is going 
to be an infinitely many solutions
