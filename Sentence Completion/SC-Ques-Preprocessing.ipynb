    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook is used to preprocess the SC-Ques Dataset so that it can be used with our project. We aim to use this additional dataset with our project to help improve the size of our testing set. This dataset was found from the paper [SC-Ques: A Sentence Completion Question Dataset for English as a Second Language Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12036). They provided a [link to their code and their data](https://github.com/ai4ed/SC-Ques) for research purposes. This, in turn, gave a link to a [dropbox containing their data](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lzznin2hxt6rmft/SC-Ques.tar.gz?dl=0). The data that we would be looking to use to expand our training set would be found in test.jsons and train.jsons. An example from train.jsons is included below.\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\"stem\": \"The plane is scheduled to arrive ___ because of bad weather. \", \"choice\": {\"A\": \"A.latest\", \"B\": \"B.later\", \"C\": \"C.late\"}, \"answer\": \"C\", \"choice_dict\": {\"choice_dict\": {\"A\": \"The plane is scheduled to arrive latest because of bad weather.\", \"B\": \"The plane is scheduled to arrive later because of bad weather.\", \"C\": \"The plane is scheduled to arrive late because of bad weather.\"}}}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "From this we would be looking to extract the 'stem' key for the question, the 'answer' key for our ans, and the choice_dict for our response options. Of note is that we will need to modify our code to allow for an arbitrarily sized choice dict. Also of note is that these questions seem less complex than the SAT questions, though some of the questions have more blanks. There are 241195 records in train.jsons and 47953 records in test.jsons.\n",

    "I am currently unsure what the csv files are, even after skimming through the paper.\n",
